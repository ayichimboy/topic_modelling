      "\n",
      "THE recent cult for Miss Austen, which has resulted in no less than ten\n",
      "new editions of her novels within a decade and three memoirs by\n",
      "different hands within as many years, have made the facts of her life\n",
      "familiar to most readers. It was a short life, and an uneventful one as\n",
      "viewed from the standpoint of our modern times, when steam and\n",
      "electricity have linked together the ends of the earth, and the very air\n",
      "seems teeming with news, agitations, discussions. We have barely time to\n",
      "recover our breath between post and post; and the morning paper with its\n",
      "statements of disaster and its hints of still greater evils to be, is\n",
      "scarcely out-lived, when, lo! in comes the evening issue, contradicting\n",
      "the news of the morning, to be sure, but full of omens and auguries of\n",
      "its own to strew our pillows with the seed of wakefulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "To us, publications come hot and hot from the press. Telegraphic wires\n",
      "like the intricate and incalculable zigzags of the lightning ramify\n",
      "above our heads; and who can tell at what moment their darts may\n",
      "strike? In Miss Austen's day the tranquil, drowsy, decorous English day\n",
      "of a century since, all was different. News travelled then from hand to\n",
      "hand, carried in creaking post-wagons, or in cases of extreme urgency by\n",
      "men on horseback. When a gentleman journeying in his own \"chaise\" took\n",
      "three days in going from Exeter to London, a distance now covered in\n",
      "three hours of railroad, there was little chance of frequent surprises.\n",
      "Love, sorrow, and death were in the world then as now, and worked their\n",
      "will upon the sons of men; but people did not expect happenings every\n",
      "day or even every year. No doubt they lived the longer for this\n",
      "exemption from excitement, and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome\n",
      "repair; but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so\n",
      "little did not stir them deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Austen's life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of\n",
      "history,--the American struggle for independence, and the French\n",
      "Revolution; but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters.\n",
      "She was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her\n",
      "brothers were in the navy and had promotion and prize-money to look\n",
      "forward to. In this connection she mentions Trafalgar and the Egyptian\n",
      "expedition, and generously remarks that she would read Southey's \"Life\n",
      "of Nelson\" if there was anything in it about her brother Frank! She\n",
      "honors Sir John Moore by remarking after his death that his mother\n",
      "would perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still\n",
      "alive; further than that, the making of the gooseberry jam and a good\n",
      "recipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and\n",
      "countermarchings, the manoeuvres and diplomacies, going on the world\n",
      "over. In the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope, triumph and\n",
      "defeat, while the fate of Britain and British liberty hung trembling in\n",
      "the balance, she sits writing her letters, trimming her caps, and\n",
      "discussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion\n",
      "wonderful to contemplate. \"The society of rural England in those days,\"\n",
      "as Mr. Goldwin Smith happily puts it, \"enjoyed a calm of its own in the\n",
      "midst of the European tempest like the windless centre of a circular\n",
      "storm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be\n",
      "circumscribed and narrow; and in this Miss Austen's charm consists.\n",
      "Seeing little, she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a\n",
      "dexterity and perfection unequalled. \"On her was bestowed, though in a\n",
      "humble form, the gift which had been bestowed on Homer, Shakespeare,\n",
      "Cervantes, Scott, and a few others,--the gift of creative power.\"\n",
      "Endowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of\n",
      "humor, she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she\n",
      "understood, giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and\n",
      "value. The things she did not see she did not attempt. Affectation was\n",
      "impossible to her,--most of all, affectation of knowledge or feeling not\n",
      "justly her own. \"She held the mirror up to her time\" with an exquisite\n",
      "sincerity and fidelity; and the closeness of her study brought her\n",
      "intimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature.\n",
      "This is the reason why, for all their skimp skirts, leg-of-mutton\n",
      "sleeves, and bygone impossible bonnets, her characters do not seem to us\n",
      "old-fashioned. Minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same\n",
      "pattern from century to century; and given a modern dress and speech,\n",
      "Emma or Elizabeth or dear Anne Eliot could enter a drawing-room to-day,\n",
      "and excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom\n",
      "they would find there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Austen's novels are dateless things,\" Mr. Augustine Birrell tells\n",
      "us. \"Nobody in his senses would speak of them as 'old novels.' 'John\n",
      "Inglesant' is an old novel, so is 'Ginx's Baby.' But Emma is quite new,\n",
      "and, like a wise woman, affords few clues to her age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We allude with a special touch of affection to Anne Eliot. \"Persuasion,\"\n",
      "which was written during the last two years of Miss Austen's life, when\n",
      "the refining touch of Eternity was already upon her, has always seemed\n",
      "to us the most perfect of her novels; and Anne, with her exquisite\n",
      "breeding and unselfish straightforwardness, just touched with the tender\n",
      "reserve of memory and regret, one of her best portraitures. But this is\n",
      "a matter of individual taste. Doubtless Elizabeth Bennet is \"better fun\"\n",
      "as the modern girl would say. Miss Austen herself preferred her. She had\n",
      "a droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how\n",
      "real they were to her own mind, and made them equally real to other\n",
      "people. In 1813 she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of Jane\n",
      "Bennet at an exhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"I was very well pleased (pray tell Fanny) with a\n",
      "      small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her.\n",
      "      I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there\n",
      "      was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps I may find her in the great\n",
      "      exhibition, which we shall go to if we have time. Mrs.\n",
      "      Bingley's is exactly like herself,--size, shaped face,\n",
      "      features and sweetness; there never was a greater\n",
      "      likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green\n",
      "      ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\n",
      "      supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I\n",
      "      dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And later:--\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\n",
      "      Reynolds'; and I am disappointed, for there was\n",
      "      nothing like Mrs. D. at either. I can only imagine\n",
      "      that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too much to like\n",
      "      it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine\n",
      "      he would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of\n",
      "      love, pride, and delicacy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the\n",
      "collection in two volumes published in 1884 by her great-nephew Lord\n",
      "Brabourne. The lightness, almost friskiness, of their tone cannot fail\n",
      "to strike the reader. Modern letters written by women are filled more or\n",
      "less with hints and queries; questionings as to the why and the\n",
      "wherefore occur; allusions to the various \"fads\" of the day, literary or\n",
      "artistic,--Ibsen, Tolstoi, Browning, Esoteric Buddhism, Wagner's Music,\n",
      "the Mind Cure, Social Science, Causes and Reforms. But Cowper and Crabbe\n",
      "were the poetical sensations in Miss Austen's time, Scott and Byron its\n",
      "phenomenal novelties; it took months to get most books printed, and\n",
      "years to persuade anybody to read them. Furthermore the letters, in all\n",
      "probability, are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial\n",
      "side of their writer. There are wide gaps of omission, covering\n",
      "important events such as Mr. Austen's death, the long illness through\n",
      "which Jane nursed her brother Henry, and the anxieties and worries which\n",
      "his failure in business caused to the whole family. What is vouchsafed\n",
      "us is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of Miss Austen's\n",
      "life; and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one. We are glad to have\n",
      "it, in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting\n",
      "part of her personality is withheld from us.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good daughter, a delightful sister, the most perfect of aunts, what\n",
      "better record could there be of a single woman? Her literary work never\n",
      "stood in the way of her home duties, any more than her \"quiet, limpid,\n",
      "unimpassioned style\" stood between her thought and her readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fame may justly be said to be almost entirely posthumous. She was\n",
      "read and praised to a moderate degree during her lifetime, but all her\n",
      "novels together brought her no more than seven hundred pounds; and her\n",
      "reputation, as it were, was in its close-sheathed bud when, at the early\n",
      "age of forty-one, she died. It would have excited in her an amused\n",
      "incredulity, no doubt, had any one predicted that two generations after\n",
      "her death the real recognition of her powers was to come. Time, which\n",
      "like desert sands has effaced the footprints of so many promising\n",
      "authors, has, with her, served as the desert wind, to blow aside those\n",
      "dusts of the commonplace which for a while concealed her true\n",
      "proportions. She is loved more than she ever hoped to be, and far more\n",
      "widely known. Mrs. Ritchie tells somewhere an anecdote of a party of\n",
      "seven assembled at a dinner-table, where the question arose of the\n",
      "locality of one of Miss Austen's places,--Maple Grove, the residence of\n",
      "Mr. Suckling, if we are not mistaken,--and six of the persons present at\n",

      "Naughty Charles did not come on Tuesday, but good Charles came yesterday\n",
      "morning. About two o'clock he walked in on a Gosport hack. His feeling\n",
      "equal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and his feeling no fatigue in it\n",
      "a still better. He walked down to Deane to dinner; he danced the whole\n",
      "evening, and to-day is no more tired than a gentleman ought to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your desiring to hear from me on Sunday will, perhaps, bring you a more\n",
      "particular account of the ball than you may care for, because one is\n",

      "than when time has entirely driven them out of one's recollection.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a pleasant evening; Charles found it remarkably so, but I cannot\n",
      "tell why, unless the absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience\n",
      "reproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent, was a relief to\n",
      "him. There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was\n",
      "merely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We\n",
      "began at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane before five. There were\n",
      "but fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of\n",
      "the county, and not many more from the other. My partners were the two\n",
      "St. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I\n",
      "called the last, and whom I liked the best of my little stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were very few beauties, and such as there were were not very\n",
      "handsome. Miss Iremonger did not look well, and Mrs. Blount was the\n",
      "only one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,\n",
      "with the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband,\n",
      "and fat neck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains\n",
      "of the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago;\n",
      "the other is refined into a nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine\n",
      "Bigg. I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I\n",
      "looked at his daughter, and thought her a queer animal with a white\n",
      "neck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained to think a very fine young woman,\n",
      "which I much regret. She danced away with great activity. Her husband is\n",
      "ugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so\n",
      "_very_ old. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with\n",
      "brown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of nose. The General has\n",
      "got the gout, and Mrs. Maitland the jaundice. Miss Debary, Susan, and\n",

      "I was as civil to them as circumstances would allow me. . . .\n",

      "\n",
      "Westgate Buildings, though quite in the lower part of the town, are not\n",

      "disinclination; it used to be lower rented than any other house in the\n",
      "row, from some inferiority in the apartments. But above all others her\n",
      "wishes are at present fixed on the corner house in Chapel Row, which\n",
      "opens into Prince's Street. Her knowledge of it, however, is confined\n",
      "only to the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being\n",
      "really desirable as of its being to be had. In the mean time she assures\n",

      "MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Where shall I begin? Which of all my important\n",
      "nothings shall I tell you first? At half after seven yesterday morning\n",
      "Henry saw us into our own carriage, and we drove away from the Bath\n",
      "Hotel; which, by the by, had been found most uncomfortable\n",
      "quarters,--very dirty, very noisy, and very ill-provided. James began\n",
      "his journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles were hot;\n",
      "Deptford Hill brought to my mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen\n",
      "years ago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the day\n",
      "advanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford, which we reached within the\n",
      "two hours and three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same inn at\n",
      "which we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the present occasion\n",
      "had about the same bad butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling on without any\n",
      "adventure reached Sittingbourne by three. Daniel was watching for us at\n",
      "the door of the George, and I was acknowledged very kindly by Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted my conversation, while\n",
      "Mary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for\n",
      "Sittingbourne; and so off we drove, drove, drove, and by six o'clock\n",
      "were at Godmersham.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our two brothers were walking before the house as we approached, as\n",
      "natural as life. Fanny and Lizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of\n",
      "pleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the breakfast-parlor, and\n",
      "then proceeded to our rooms. Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the\n",
      "Yellow room--very literally--for I am writing in it at this moment. It\n",
      "seems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself, and to be at\n",
      "Godmersham without you is also odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who came to me as soon as she\n",
      "had seen her Aunt James to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as\n",
      "energetic as usual in her longings for you. She is grown both in height\n",
      "and size since last year, but not immoderately, looks very well, and\n",
      "seems as to conduct and manner just what she was and what one could wish\n",
      "her to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth,[5] who was dressing when we arrived, came to me for a minute\n",
      "attended by Marianne, Charles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave\n",
      "me a very affectionate welcome. That I had received such from Edward\n",
      "also I need not mention; but I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I\n",
      "never saw him look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly\n",
      "well. I cannot praise Elizabeth's looks, but they are probably affected\n",
      "by a cold. Her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three\n",
      "years, though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is not quite so\n",
      "lovely as he was. Louisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find\n",
      "handsomer than I expected, though at present disguised by such a violent\n",
      "breaking-out that she does not come down after dinner. She has charming\n",
      "eyes and a nice open countenance, and seems likely to be very lovable.\n",
      "Her size is magnificent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was agreeably surprised to find Louisa Bridges still here. She looks\n",
      "remarkably well (legacies are very wholesome diet), and is just what she\n",
      "always was. John is at Sandling. You may fancy our dinner-party\n",
      "therefore; Fanny, of course, belonging to it, and little Edward, for\n",
      "that day. He was almost too happy, his happiness at least made him too\n",
      "talkative.\n",

      "It has struck ten; I must go to breakfast.\n",

      "wanted to know James's plans and mine, and from what his own now are I\n",
      "think it already nearly certain that I shall return when they do, though\n",
      "not with them. Edward will be going about the same time to Alton, where\n",
      "he has business with Mr. Trimmer, and where he means his son should join\n",
      "him; and I shall probably be his companion to that place, and get on\n",
      "afterwards somehow or other.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should have preferred a rather longer stay here certainly, but there\n",
      "is no prospect of any later conveyance for me, as he does not mean to\n",
      "accompany Edward on his return to Winchester, from a very natural\n",
      "unwillingness to leave Elizabeth at that time. I shall at any rate be\n",
      "glad not to be obliged to be an incumbrance on those who have brought me\n",
      "here, for, as James has no horse, I must feel in their carriage that I\n",
      "am taking his place. We were rather crowded yesterday, though it does\n",
      "not become me to say so, as I and my boa were of the party, and it is\n",
      "not to be supposed but that a child of three years of age was fidgety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need scarcely beg you to keep all this to yourself, lest it should get\n",

      "MY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I have so many little matters to tell you of, that I\n",
      "cannot wait any longer before I begin to put them down. I spent Tuesday\n",
      "in Bentinck Street. The Cookes called here and took me back, and it was\n",
      "quite a Cooke day, for the Miss Rolles paid a visit while I was there,\n",
      "and Sam Arnold dropped in to tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine,--that\n",
      "of calling on Miss Beckford again; but from the middle of the day it\n",
      "rained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing of her father and\n",
      "mother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had\n",
      "some amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always\n",
      "inclines me to attend more to the company than the sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called;\n",
      "it was owing to a blunder among the servants, for she did not know of\n",
      "our visit till we were gone. She seems tolerably well, but the nervous\n",
      "part of her complaint, I fear, increases, and makes her more and more\n",
      "unwilling to part with Mary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have proposed to the latter that she should go to Chawton with me, on\n",
      "the supposition of my travelling the Guildford road, and she, I do\n",
      "believe, would be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;\n",
      "unless a brother can be at home at that time, it certainly must. George\n",

      "\n",
      "I did not see Theo. till late on Tuesday; he was gone to Ilford, but he\n",
      "came back in time to show his usual nothing-meaning, harmless, heartless\n",
      "civility. Henry, who had been confined the whole day to the bank, took\n",
      "me in his way home, and, after putting life and wit into the party for a\n",
      "quarter of an hour, put himself and his sister into a hackney coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bless my stars that I have done with Tuesday. But, alas! Wednesday was\n",
      "likewise a day of great doings, for Manon and I took our walk to Grafton\n",

      "for which I was obliged to give seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by\n",
      "a pretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it on the chance of\n",
      "your liking it; but at the same time, if it should not suit you, you\n",
      "must not think yourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3_s._\n",
      "6_d._ per yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping the whole. In\n",
      "texture it is just what we prefer, but its resemblance to green crewels,\n",
      "I must own, is not great, for the pattern is a small red spot. And now I\n",
      "believe I have done all my commissions except Wedgwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked my walk very much; it was shorter than I had expected, and the\n",
      "weather was delightful. We set off immediately after breakfast, and must\n",
      "have reached Grafton House by half-past eleven; but when we entered the\n",
      "shop the whole counter was thronged, and we waited full half an hour\n",
      "before we could be attended to. When we were served, however, I was\n",
      "very well satisfied with my purchases,--my bugle trimming at 2_s._ 4_d._\n",
      "and three pair silk stockings for a little less than 12_s._ a pair.\n",

      "In my way back who should I meet but Mr. Moore, just come from\n",

      "me one. I am really very shocking, but it will not be dear at a guinea.\n",
      "Our pelisses are 17_s._ each; she charges only 8_s._ for the making, but\n",

      "some very good music,--five professionals, three of them glee singers,\n",
      "besides amateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings is a\n",
      "Capital on the harp, from which I expect great pleasure. The foundation\n",
      "of the party was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter, but the\n",
      "latter leaves town the day before. I am sorry, as I wished her prejudice\n",
      "to be done away, but should have been more sorry if there had been no\n",

      "\n",
      "I am a wretch, to be so occupied with all these things as to seem to\n",
      "have no thoughts to give to people and circumstances which really supply\n",
      "a far more lasting interest,--the society in which you are; but I do\n",
      "think of you all, I assure you, and want to know all about everybody,\n",

      "inquire further to-day. He wrote to Mary on the occasion. This is\n",
      "something to think of. Henry is convinced that he will have the offer of\n",

      "Sloane Street on the 1st or 2d, and be ready for James on the 9th, and,\n",

      "\n",
      "I wrote to Mr. Murray yesterday myself, and Henry wrote at the same time\n",
      "to Roworth. Before the notes were out of the house, I received three\n",
      "sheets and an apology from R. We sent the notes, however, and I had a\n",
      "most civil one in reply from Mr. M. He is so very polite, indeed, that\n",
      "it is quite overcoming. The printers have been waiting for paper,--the\n",
      "blame is thrown upon the stationer; but he gives his word that I shall\n",

      "and Scott, and says that any book of his will always be at my service.\n",
      "In short, I am soothed and complimented into tolerable comfort.\n",

      "pheasants. We have some hope of Edward's coming to dinner to-day; he\n",
      "will, if he can, I believe. He is looking extremely well.\n",
      "\n",
      "To-morrow Mr. Haden is to dine with us. There is happiness! We really\n",
      "grow so fond of Mr. Haden that I do not know what to expect. He and Mr.\n",
      "Tilson and Mr. Philips made up our circle of wits last night. Fanny\n",
      "played, and he sat and listened and suggested improvements, till Richard\n",
      "came in to tell him that \"the doctor was waiting for him at Captn.\n",
      "Blake's;\" and then he was off with a speed that you can imagine. He\n",
      "never does appear in the least above his profession or out of humor\n",
      "with it, or I should think poor Captn. Blake, whoever he is, in a very\n",
      "bad way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have misunderstood Henry when I told you that you were to hear\n",

      "have amused him, I am sure one part, alas! cannot be very amusing to\n",
      "anybody. I wonder that with such business to worry him he can be getting\n",
      "better; but he certainly does gain strength, and if you and Edwd. were\n",

      "deceive you, if I do, as to my estimation of the climate of London), and\n",
      "he ventured first on the balcony and then as far as the greenhouse. He\n",
      "caught no cold, and therefore has done more to-day, with great delight\n",
      "and self-persuasion of improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been to see Mrs. Tilson and the Malings. By the by, you may talk\n",

      "drink tea with us to-morrow, and, as it was accepted, here is an end of\n",
      "our extreme felicity in our dinner guest. I am heartily sorry they are\n",

      "\n",
      "Another little disappointment: Mr. H. advises Henry's not venturing with\n",
      "us in the carriage to-morrow; if it were spring, he says, it would be a\n",
      "different thing. One would rather this had not been. He seems to think\n",
      "his going out to-day rather imprudent, though acknowledging at the same\n",
      "time that he is better than he was in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fanny has had a letter full of commissions from Goodnestone; we shall be\n",

      "Nothing, I trust, will keep us from Keppel Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "This day has brought a most friendly letter from Mr. Fowle, with a brace\n",

      "I might dedicate, etc., for fear of being obliged to do it, and that she\n",
      "is thoroughly convinced of my being influenced now by nothing but the\n",

      "for; and though we could stay only a quarter of an hour, Fanny's calling\n",
      "gave great pleasure, and her sensibility still greater, for she was very\n",

      "three days in going from Exeter to London, a distance now covered in\n",

      "day or even every year. No doubt they lived the longer for this\n",
      "exemption from excitement, and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome\n",
      "repair; but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so\n",
      "little did not stir them deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Austen's life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of\n",
      "history,--the American struggle for independence, and the French\n",
      "Revolution; but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters.\n",
      "She was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her\n",
      "brothers were in the navy and had promotion and prize-money to look\n",
      "forward to. In this connection she mentions Trafalgar and the Egyptian\n",
      "expedition, and generously remarks that she would read Southey's \"Life\n",
      "of Nelson\" if there was anything in it about her brother Frank! She\n",
      "honors Sir John Moore by remarking after his death that his mother\n",
      "would perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still\n",
      "alive; further than that, the making of the gooseberry jam and a good\n",
      "recipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and\n",
      "countermarchings, the manoeuvres and diplomacies, going on the world\n",
      "over. In the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope, triumph and\n",
      "defeat, while the fate of Britain and British liberty hung trembling in\n",
      "the balance, she sits writing her letters, trimming her caps, and\n",
      "discussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion\n",
      "wonderful to contemplate. \"The society of rural England in those days,\"\n",
      "as Mr. Goldwin Smith happily puts it, \"enjoyed a calm of its own in the\n",
      "midst of the European tempest like the windless centre of a circular\n",
      "storm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be\n",
      "circumscribed and narrow; and in this Miss Austen's charm consists.\n",
      "Seeing little, she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a\n",
      "dexterity and perfection unequalled. \"On her was bestowed, though in a\n",
      "humble form, the gift which had been bestowed on Homer, Shakespeare,\n",
      "Cervantes, Scott, and a few others,--the gift of creative power.\"\n",
      "Endowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of\n",
      "humor, she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she\n",
      "understood, giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and\n",
      "value. The things she did not see she did not attempt. Affectation was\n",
      "impossible to her,--most of all, affectation of knowledge or feeling not\n",
      "justly her own. \"She held the mirror up to her time\" with an exquisite\n",
      "sincerity and fidelity; and the closeness of her study brought her\n",
      "intimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature.\n",
      "This is the reason why, for all their skimp skirts, leg-of-mutton\n",
      "sleeves, and bygone impossible bonnets, her characters do not seem to us\n",
      "old-fashioned. Minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same\n",
      "pattern from century to century; and given a modern dress and speech,\n",
      "Emma or Elizabeth or dear Anne Eliot could enter a drawing-room to-day,\n",
      "and excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom\n",
      "they would find there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Austen's novels are dateless things,\" Mr. Augustine Birrell tells\n",
      "us. \"Nobody in his senses would speak of them as 'old novels.' 'John\n",
      "Inglesant' is an old novel, so is 'Ginx's Baby.' But Emma is quite new,\n",
      "and, like a wise woman, affords few clues to her age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We allude with a special touch of affection to Anne Eliot. \"Persuasion,\"\n",
      "which was written during the last two years of Miss Austen's life, when\n",
      "the refining touch of Eternity was already upon her, has always seemed\n",
      "to us the most perfect of her novels; and Anne, with her exquisite\n",
      "breeding and unselfish straightforwardness, just touched with the tender\n",
      "reserve of memory and regret, one of her best portraitures. But this is\n",
      "a matter of individual taste. Doubtless Elizabeth Bennet is \"better fun\"\n",
      "as the modern girl would say. Miss Austen herself preferred her. She had\n",
      "a droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how\n",
      "real they were to her own mind, and made them equally real to other\n",
      "people. In 1813 she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of Jane\n",
      "Bennet at an exhibition.\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"I was very well pleased (pray tell Fanny) with a\n",
      "      small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her.\n",
      "      I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there\n",
      "      was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps I may find her in the great\n",
      "      exhibition, which we shall go to if we have time. Mrs.\n",
      "      Bingley's is exactly like herself,--size, shaped face,\n",
      "      features and sweetness; there never was a greater\n",
      "      likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green\n",
      "      ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\n",
      "      supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I\n",
      "      dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And later:--\n",
      "\n",
      "      \"We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\n",
      "      Reynolds'; and I am disappointed, for there was\n",
      "      nothing like Mrs. D. at either. I can only imagine\n",
      "      that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too much to like\n",
      "      it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine\n",
      "      he would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of\n",
      "      love, pride, and delicacy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the\n",
      "collection in two volumes published in 1884 by her great-nephew Lord\n",
      "Brabourne. The lightness, almost friskiness, of their tone cannot fail\n",
      "to strike the reader. Modern letters written by women are filled more or\n",
      "less with hints and queries; questionings as to the why and the\n",
      "wherefore occur; allusions to the various \"fads\" of the day, literary or\n",
      "artistic,--Ibsen, Tolstoi, Browning, Esoteric Buddhism, Wagner's Music,\n",
      "the Mind Cure, Social Science, Causes and Reforms. But Cowper and Crabbe\n",
      "were the poetical sensations in Miss Austen's time, Scott and Byron its\n",
      "phenomenal novelties; it took months to get most books printed, and\n",
      "years to persuade anybody to read them. Furthermore the letters, in all\n",
      "probability, are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial\n",
      "side of their writer. There are wide gaps of omission, covering\n",
      "important events such as Mr. Austen's death, the long illness through\n",
      "which Jane nursed her brother Henry, and the anxieties and worries which\n",
      "his failure in business caused to the whole family. What is vouchsafed\n",
      "us is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of Miss Austen's\n",
      "life; and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one. We are glad to have\n",
      "it, in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting\n",
      "part of her personality is withheld from us.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good daughter, a delightful sister, the most perfect of aunts, what\n",
      "better record could there be of a single woman? Her literary work never\n",
      "stood in the way of her home duties, any more than her \"quiet, limpid,\n",
      "unimpassioned style\" stood between her thought and her readers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fame may justly be said to be almost entirely posthumous. She was\n",
      "read and praised to a moderate degree during her lifetime, but all her\n",
      "novels together brought her no more than seven hundred pounds; and her\n",
      "reputation, as it were, was in its close-sheathed bud when, at the early\n",
      "age of forty-one, she died. It would have excited in her an amused\n",
      "incredulity, no doubt, had any one predicted that two generations after\n",
      "her death the real recognition of her powers was to come. Time, which\n",
      "like desert sands has effaced the footprints of so many promising\n",
      "authors, has, with her, served as the desert wind, to blow aside those\n",
      "dusts of the commonplace which for a while concealed her true\n",
      "proportions. She is loved more than she ever hoped to be, and far more\n",
      "widely known. Mrs. Ritchie tells somewhere an anecdote of a party of\n",
      "seven assembled at a dinner-table, where the question arose of the\n",
      "locality of one of Miss Austen's places,--Maple Grove, the residence of\n",
      "Mr. Suckling, if we are not mistaken,--and six of the persons present at\n",
      "once recognized the allusion, and had a formed opinion on the subject.\n",
      "The seventh was a Frenchman who did not read English!\n",
      "\n",
      "Scott, Macaulay, Sir James Mackintosh, Miss Martineau, Mrs. Ritchie,\n",
      "Miss Mitford, and a host of others have vied in their generous tributes\n",
      "of admiration. But most striking of all, to our thinking, is that paid\n",
      "to Miss Austen by Lord Tennyson when, in some visit to Lyme not many\n",
      "years since, those with him pointed out this and the other feature of\n",

      "I HAVE just received yours and Mary's letter, and I thank you both,\n",
      "though their contents might have been more agreeable. I do not at all\n",
      "expect to see you on Tuesday, since matters have fallen out so\n",
      "unpleasantly; and if you are not able to return till after that day, it\n",
      "will hardly be possible for us to send for you before Saturday, though\n",
      "for my own part I care so little about the ball that it would be no\n",
      "sacrifice to me to give it up for the sake of seeing you two days\n",
      "earlier. We are extremely sorry for poor Eliza's illness. I trust,\n",
      "however, that she has continued to recover since you wrote, and that you\n",
      "will none of you be the worse for your attendance on her. What a\n",
      "good-for-nothing fellow Charles is to bespeak the stockings! I hope he\n",
      "will be too hot all the rest of his life for it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I sent you a letter yesterday to Ibthorp, which I suppose you will not\n",
      "receive at Kintbury. It was not very long or very witty, and therefore\n",
      "if you never receive it, it does not much signify. I wrote principally\n",
      "to tell you that the Coopers were arrived and in good health. The little\n",
      "boy is very like Dr. Cooper, and the little girl is to resemble Jane,\n",

      "wind should be favorable on Sunday, which it proved to be, they were to\n",
      "sail from Falmouth on that day. By this time, therefore, they are at\n",
      "Barbadoes, I suppose. The Rivers are still at Manydown, and are to be at\n",
      "Ashe to-morrow. I intended to call on the Miss Biggs yesterday had the\n",

      "her sole use and benefit in future, and not only him, but all my other\n",

      "which C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I mean to confine myself in\n",
      "future to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care sixpence. Assure her\n",

      "wonder what he means by being so civil. There is a report that Tom is\n",
      "going to be married to a Lichfield lass. John Lyford and his sister\n",
      "bring Edward home to-day, dine with us, and we shall all go together to\n",

      "fatigued on her arrival at this place, has been refreshed by a\n",
      "comfortable dinner, and now seems quite stout. It wanted five minutes of\n",
      "twelve when we left Sittingbourne, from whence we had a famous pair of\n",
      "horses, which took us to Rochester in an hour and a quarter; the postboy\n",

      "\n",

      "heavy, and our horses very indifferent. However, we were in such good\n",

      "little importance to us; and as it was, we were very little more than\n",
      "two hours and a half coming hither, and it was scarcely past four when\n",
      "we stopped at the inn. My mother took some of her bitters at Ospringe,\n",
      "and some more at Rochester, and she ate some bread several times.\n",

      "single-bedded room; in the former my mother and I are to sleep. I shall\n",
      "leave you to guess who is to occupy the other. We sate down to dinner a\n",

      "oyster sauce.\n",

      "I should have begun my letter soon after our arrival, but for a little\n",

      "accident put into a chaise which was just packing off as we came in, and\n",
      "were driven away toward Gravesend in their way to the West Indies. No\n",
      "part of my property could have been such a prize before, for in my\n",

      "no narrow braces for children, and scarcely any notting silk; but Miss\n",
      "Wood, as usual, is going to town very soon, and will lay in a fresh\n",
      "stock. I gave 2_s._ 3_d._ a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it is not\n",

      "by four o'clock. I suppose John has told you in what manner we were\n",

      "about five; amongst other things we had asparagus and a lobster, which\n",
      "made me wish for you, and some cheesecakes, on which the children made\n",

      "very well pleased with the whole of it. Poor Elizabeth has had a dismal\n",
      "ride of it from Devizes, for it has rained almost all the way, and our\n",

      "I have got so many things to say, so many things equally important, that\n",

      "In Paragon we met Mrs. Foley and Mrs. Dowdeswell with her yellow shawl\n",

      "lengthened. I feel tolerably secure of our getting away next week,\n",
      "though it is certainly possible that we may remain till Thursday the\n",
      "27th. I wonder what we shall do with all our intended visits this\n",
      "summer! I should like to make a compromise with Adlestrop, Harden, and\n",

      "never disagreed with him in any respect, we are inclined to hope that he\n",
      "will derive advantage from them in the end. Everybody encourages us in\n",
      "this expectation, for they all say that the effect of the waters cannot\n",
      "be negative, and many are the instances in which their benefit is felt\n",
      "afterwards more than on the spot. He is more comfortable here than I\n",
      "thought he would be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will both, I\n",
      "believe, be very glad to get away--the latter especially, which one\n",
      "can't wonder at somehow. So much for Mrs. Piozzi. I had some thoughts of\n",
      "writing the whole of my letter in her style, but I believe I shall not.\n",

      "have been to the cheap shop, and very cheap we found it, but there are\n",
      "only flowers made there, no fruit; and as I could get four or five very\n",
      "pretty sprigs of the former for the same money which would procure only\n",
      "one Orleans plum--in short, could get more for three or four shillings\n",
      "than I could have means of bringing home--I cannot decide on the fruit\n",
      "till I hear from you again. Besides, I cannot help thinking that it is\n",

      "you think on that subject?\n",

      "very cunning, but I saw through her design; she means to publish it from\n",
      "memory, and one more perusal must enable her to do it. As for\n",
      "\"Fitzalbini,\" when I get home she shall have it, as soon as ever she\n",
      "will own that Mr. Elliott is handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair men are\n",

      "Evelyn called on us, and her manners were so pleasing that we liked the\n",
      "idea of going very much. The Biggs would call her a nice woman. But Mr.\n",
      "Evelyn, who was indisposed yesterday, is worse to-day, and we are put\n",
      "off.\n",

      "equal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and his feeling no fatigue in it\n",
      "a still better. He walked down to Deane to dinner; he danced the whole\n",

      "It was a pleasant evening; Charles found it remarkably so, but I cannot\n",
      "tell why, unless the absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience\n",
      "reproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent, was a relief to\n",
      "him. There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was\n",
      "merely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We\n",
      "began at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane before five. There were\n",
      "but fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of\n",
      "the county, and not many more from the other. My partners were the two\n",
      "St. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I\n",
      "called the last, and whom I liked the best of my little stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were very few beauties, and such as there were were not very\n",
      "handsome. Miss Iremonger did not look well, and Mrs. Blount was the\n",
      "only one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,\n",
      "with the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband,\n",
      "and fat neck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains\n",
      "of the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago;\n",
      "the other is refined into a nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine\n",
      "Bigg. I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I\n",
      "looked at his daughter, and thought her a queer animal with a white\n",
      "neck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained to think a very fine young woman,\n",
      "which I much regret. She danced away with great activity. Her husband is\n",
      "ugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so\n",
      "_very_ old. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with\n",
      "brown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of nose. The General has\n",
      "got the gout, and Mrs. Maitland the jaundice. Miss Debary, Susan, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Westgate Buildings, though quite in the lower part of the town, are not\n",

      "disinclination; it used to be lower rented than any other house in the\n",

      "only to the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being\n",

      "his journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles were hot;\n",
      "Deptford Hill brought to my mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen\n",
      "years ago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the day\n",
      "advanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford, which we reached within the\n",
      "two hours and three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same inn at\n",
      "which we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the present occasion\n",
      "had about the same bad butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling on without any\n",
      "adventure reached Sittingbourne by three. Daniel was watching for us at\n",

      "Mrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted my conversation, while\n",
      "Mary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for\n",

      "were at Godmersham.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our two brothers were walking before the house as we approached, as\n",
      "natural as life. Fanny and Lizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of\n",

      "then proceeded to our rooms. Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the\n",
      "Yellow room--very literally--for I am writing in it at this moment. It\n",
      "seems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself, and to be at\n",

      "\n",
      "You are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who came to me as soon as she\n",
      "had seen her Aunt James to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as\n",
      "energetic as usual in her longings for you. She is grown both in height\n",
      "and size since last year, but not immoderately, looks very well, and\n",

      "also I need not mention; but I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I\n",
      "never saw him look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly\n",
      "well. I cannot praise Elizabeth's looks, but they are probably affected\n",
      "by a cold. Her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three\n",
      "years, though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is not quite so\n",
      "lovely as he was. Louisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find\n",
      "handsomer than I expected, though at present disguised by such a violent\n",
      "breaking-out that she does not come down after dinner. She has charming\n",
      "eyes and a nice open countenance, and seems likely to be very lovable.\n",
      "Her size is magnificent.\n",

      "The badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine,--that\n",
      "of calling on Miss Beckford again; but from the middle of the day it\n",
      "rained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing of her father and\n",
      "mother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had\n",
      "some amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called;\n",
      "it was owing to a blunder among the servants, for she did not know of\n",

      "I have proposed to the latter that she should go to Chawton with me, on\n",
      "the supposition of my travelling the Guildford road, and she, I do\n",
      "believe, would be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;\n",

      "me in his way home, and, after putting life and wit into the party for a\n",

      "for which I was obliged to give seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by\n",
      "a pretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it on the chance of\n",
      "your liking it; but at the same time, if it should not suit you, you\n",
      "must not think yourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3_s._\n",
      "6_d._ per yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping the whole. In\n",
      "texture it is just what we prefer, but its resemblance to green crewels,\n",
      "I must own, is not great, for the pattern is a small red spot. And now I\n",
      "believe I have done all my commissions except Wedgwood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked my walk very much; it was shorter than I had expected, and the\n",
      "weather was delightful. We set off immediately after breakfast, and must\n",
      "have reached Grafton House by half-past eleven; but when we entered the\n",
      "shop the whole counter was thronged, and we waited full half an hour\n",
      "before we could be attended to. When we were served, however, I was\n",
      "very well satisfied with my purchases,--my bugle trimming at 2_s._ 4_d._\n",

      "besides amateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings is a\n",
      "Capital on the harp, from which I expect great pleasure. The foundation\n",
      "of the party was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter, but the\n",
      "latter leaves town the day before. I am sorry, as I wished her prejudice\n",

      "of leaders put on to the bottom of Sloane St. His own horses, therefore,\n",
      "cannot have had hard work. I watched for veils as we drove through the\n",
      "streets, and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads. And\n",
      "now, how do you all do?--you in particular, after the worry of yesterday\n",

      "several times. What wicked people dyers are! They begin with dipping\n",
      "their own souls in scarlet sin. It is evening. We have drank tea, and I\n",
      "have torn through the third vol. of the \"Heroine.\" I do not think it\n",
      "falls off. It is a delightful burlesque, particularly on the Radcliffe\n",

J. PARKHILL & CO., BOSTON, U. S. A.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE.\\n\\n\\nTHE recent cult for Miss Austen, which has resulted in no less than ten\\nnew editions of her novels within a decade and three memoirs by\\ndifferent hands within as many years, have made the facts of her life\\nfamiliar to most readers. It was a short life, and an uneventful one as\\nviewed from the standpoint of our modern times, when steam and\\nelectricity have linked together the ends of the earth, and the very air\\nseems teeming with news, agitations, discussions. We have barely time to\\nrecover our breath between post and post; and the morning paper with its\\nstatements of disaster and its hints of still greater evils to be, is\\nscarcely out-lived, when, lo! in comes the evening issue, contradicting\\nthe news of the morning, to be sure, but full of omens and auguries of\\nits own to strew our pillows with the seed of wakefulness.\\n\\nTo us, publications come hot and hot from the press. Telegraphic wires\\nlike the intricate and incalculable zigzags of the lightning ramify\\nabove our heads; and who can tell at what moment their darts may\\nstrike? In Miss Austen\\'s day the tranquil, drowsy, decorous English day\\nof a century since, all was different. News travelled then from hand to\\nhand, carried in creaking post-wagons, or in cases of extreme urgency by\\nmen on horseback. When a gentleman journeying in his own \"chaise\" took\\nthree days in going from Exeter to London, a distance now covered in\\nthree hours of railroad, there was little chance of frequent surprises.\\nLove, sorrow, and death were in the world then as now, and worked their\\nwill upon the sons of men; but people did not expect happenings every\\nday or even every year. No doubt they lived the longer for this\\nexemption from excitement, and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome\\nrepair; but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so\\nlittle did not stir them deeply.\\n\\nMiss Austen\\'s life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of\\nhistory,--the American struggle for independence, and the French\\nRevolution; but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters.\\nShe was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her\\nbrothers were in the navy and had promotion and prize-money to look\\nforward to. In this connection she mentions Trafalgar and the Egyptian\\nexpedition, and generously remarks that she would read Southey\\'s \"Life\\nof Nelson\" if there was anything in it about her brother Frank! She\\nhonors Sir John Moore by remarking after his death that his mother\\nwould perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still\\nalive; further than that, the making of the gooseberry jam and a good\\nrecipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and\\ncountermarchings, the manoeuvres and diplomacies, going on the world\\nover. In the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope, triumph and\\ndefeat, while the fate of Britain and British liberty hung trembling in\\nthe balance, she sits writing her letters, trimming her caps, and\\ndiscussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion\\nwonderful to contemplate. \"The society of rural England in those days,\"\\nas Mr. Goldwin Smith happily puts it, \"enjoyed a calm of its own in the\\nmidst of the European tempest like the windless centre of a circular\\nstorm.\"\\n\\nThe point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be\\ncircumscribed and narrow; and in this Miss Austen\\'s charm consists.\\nSeeing little, she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a\\ndexterity and perfection unequalled. \"On her was bestowed, though in a\\nhumble form, the gift which had been bestowed on Homer, Shakespeare,\\nCervantes, Scott, and a few others,--the gift of creative power.\"\\nEndowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of\\nhumor, she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she\\nunderstood, giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and\\nvalue. The things she did not see she did not attempt. Affectation was\\nimpossible to her,--most of all, affectation of knowledge or feeling not\\njustly her own. \"She held the mirror up to her time\" with an exquisite\\nsincerity and fidelity; and the closeness of her study brought her\\nintimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature.\\nThis is the reason why, for all their skimp skirts, leg-of-mutton\\nsleeves, and bygone impossible bonnets, her characters do not seem to us\\nold-fashioned. Minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same\\npattern from century to century; and given a modern dress and speech,\\nEmma or Elizabeth or dear Anne Eliot could enter a drawing-room to-day,\\nand excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom\\nthey would find there.\\n\\n\"Miss Austen\\'s novels are dateless things,\" Mr. Augustine Birrell tells\\nus. \"Nobody in his senses would speak of them as \\'old novels.\\' \\'John\\nInglesant\\' is an old novel, so is \\'Ginx\\'s Baby.\\' But Emma is quite new,\\nand, like a wise woman, affords few clues to her age.\"\\n\\nWe allude with a special touch of affection to Anne Eliot. \"Persuasion,\"\\nwhich was written during the last two years of Miss Austen\\'s life, when\\nthe refining touch of Eternity was already upon her, has always seemed\\nto us the most perfect of her novels; and Anne, with her exquisite\\nbreeding and unselfish straightforwardness, just touched with the tender\\nreserve of memory and regret, one of her best portraitures. But this is\\na matter of individual taste. Doubtless Elizabeth Bennet is \"better fun\"\\nas the modern girl would say. Miss Austen herself preferred her. She had\\na droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how\\nreal they were to her own mind, and made them equally real to other\\npeople. In 1813 she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of Jane\\nBennet at an exhibition.\\n\\n      \"I was very well pleased (pray tell Fanny) with a\\n      small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her.\\n      I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there\\n      was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps I may find her in the great\\n      exhibition, which we shall go to if we have time. Mrs.\\n      Bingley\\'s is exactly like herself,--size, shaped face,\\n      features and sweetness; there never was a greater\\n      likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green\\n      ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\\n      supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I\\n      dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow.\"\\n\\nAnd later:--\\n\\n      \"We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\\n      Reynolds\\'; and I am disappointed, for there was\\n      nothing like Mrs. D. at either. I can only imagine\\n      that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too much to like\\n      it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine\\n      he would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of\\n      love, pride, and delicacy.\"\\n\\nThe letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the\\ncollection in two volumes published in 1884 by her great-nephew Lord\\nBrabourne. The lightness, almost friskiness, of their tone cannot fail\\nto strike the reader. Modern letters written by women are filled more or\\nless with hints and queries; questionings as to the why and the\\nwherefore occur; allusions to the various \"fads\" of the day, literary or\\nartistic,--Ibsen, Tolstoi, Browning, Esoteric Buddhism, Wagner\\'s Music,\\nthe Mind Cure, Social Science, Causes and Reforms. But Cowper and Crabbe\\nwere the poetical sensations in Miss Austen\\'s time, Scott and Byron its\\nphenomenal novelties; it took months to get most books printed, and\\nyears to persuade anybody to read them. Furthermore the letters, in all\\nprobability, are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial\\nside of their writer. There are wide gaps of omission, covering\\nimportant events such as Mr. Austen\\'s death, the long illness through\\nwhich Jane nursed her brother Henry, and the anxieties and worries which\\nhis failure in business caused to the whole family. What is vouchsafed\\nus is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of Miss Austen\\'s\\nlife; and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one. We are glad to have\\nit, in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting\\npart of her personality is withheld from us.\\n\\nA good daughter, a delightful sister, the most perfect of aunts, what\\nbetter record could there be of a single woman? Her literary work never\\nstood in the way of her home duties, any more than her \"quiet, limpid,\\nunimpassioned style\" stood between her thought and her readers.\\n\\nHer fame may justly be said to be almost entirely posthumous. She was\\nread and praised to a moderate degree during her lifetime, but all her\\nnovels together brought her no more than seven hundred pounds; and her\\nreputation, as it were, was in its close-sheathed bud when, at the early\\nage of forty-one, she died. It would have excited in her an amused\\nincredulity, no doubt, had any one predicted that two generations after\\nher death the real recognition of her powers was to come. Time, which\\nlike desert sands has effaced the footprints of so many promising\\nauthors, has, with her, served as the desert wind, to blow aside those\\ndusts of the commonplace which for a while concealed her true\\nproportions. She is loved more than she ever hoped to be, and far more\\nwidely known. Mrs. Ritchie tells somewhere an anecdote of a party of\\nseven assembled at a dinner-table, where the question arose of the\\nlocality of one of Miss Austen\\'s places,--Maple Grove, the residence of\\nMr. Suckling, if we are not mistaken,--and six of the persons present at\\nonce recognized the allusion, and had a formed opinion on the subject.\\nThe seventh was a Frenchman who did not read English!\\n\\nScott, Macaulay, Sir James Mackintosh, Miss Martineau, Mrs. Ritchie,\\nMiss Mitford, and a host of others have vied in their generous tributes\\nof admiration. But most striking of all, to our thinking, is that paid\\nto Miss Austen by Lord Tennyson when, in some visit to Lyme not many\\nyears since, those with him pointed out this and the other feature of\\nthe place only to be interrupted with--\"Never mind all that. Show me the\\nexact spot where Louisa Musgrove fell!\" Could non-historical\\nverisimilitude go farther or mean more?\\n\\n                                                      S. C.

       " \"                             STEVENTON, Thursday (January 16, 1796).\\n\\nI HAVE just received yours and Mary's letter, and I thank you both,\\nthough their contents might have been more agreeable. I do not at all\\nexpect to see you on Tuesday, since matters have fallen out so\\nunpleasantly; and if you are not able to return till after that day, it\\nwill hardly be possible for us to send for you before Saturday, though\\nfor my own part I care so little about the ball that it would be no\\nsacrifice to me to give it up for the sake of seeing you two days\\nearlier. We are extremely sorry for poor Eliza's illness. I trust,\\nhowever, that she has continued to recover since you wrote, and that you\\nwill none of you be the worse for your attendance on her. What a\\ngood-for-nothing fellow Charles is to bespeak the stockings! I hope he\\nwill be too hot all the rest of his life for it!\\n\\nI sent you a letter yesterday to Ibthorp, which I suppose you will not\\nreceive at Kintbury. It was not very long or very witty, and therefore\\nif you never receive it, it does not much signify. I wrote principally\\nto tell you that the Coopers were arrived and in good health. The little\\nboy is very like Dr. Cooper, and the little girl is to resemble Jane,\\nthey say.\\n\\nOur party to Ashe to-morrow night will consist of Edward Cooper, James\\n(for a ball is nothing without him), Buller, who is now staying with us,\\nand I. I look forward with great impatience to it, as I rather expect to\\nreceive an offer from my friend in the course of the evening. I shall\\nrefuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat.\\n\\nI am very much flattered by your commendation of my last letter, for I\\nwrite only for fame, and without any view to pecuniary emolument.\\n\\nEdward is gone to spend the day with his friend, John Lyford, and does\\nnot return till to-morrow. Anna is now here; she came up in her chaise\\nto spend the day with her young cousins, but she does not much take to\\nthem or to anything about them, except Caroline's spinning-wheel. I am\\nvery glad to find from Mary that Mr. and Mrs. Fowle are pleased with\\nyou. I hope you will continue to give satisfaction.\\n\\nHow impertinent you are to write to me about Tom, as if I had not\\nopportunities of hearing from him myself! The last letter that I\\nreceived from him was dated on Friday, 8th, and he told me that if the\\nwind should be favorable on Sunday, which it proved to be, they were to\\nsail from Falmouth on that day. By this time, therefore, they are at\\nBarbadoes, I suppose. The Rivers are still at Manydown, and are to be at\\nAshe to-morrow. I intended to call on the Miss Biggs yesterday had the\\nweather been tolerable. Caroline, Anna, and I have just been devouring\\nsome cold souse, and it would be difficult to say which enjoyed it most.\\n\\nTell Mary that I make over Mr. Heartley and all his estate to her for\\nher sole use and benefit in future, and not only him, but all my other\\nadmirers into the bargain wherever she can find them, even the kiss\\nwhich C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I mean to confine myself in\\nfuture to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care sixpence. Assure her\\nalso, as a last and indubitable proof of Warren's indifference to me,\\nthat he actually drew that gentleman's picture for me, and delivered it\\nto me without a sigh.\\n\\n_Friday._--At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with\\nTom Lefroy, and when you receive this it will be over. My tears flow as\\nI write at the melancholy idea. Wm. Chute called here yesterday. I\\nwonder what he means by being so civil. There is a report that Tom is\\ngoing to be married to a Lichfield lass. John Lyford and his sister\\nbring Edward home to-day, dine with us, and we shall all go together to\\nAshe. I understand that we are to draw for partners. I shall be\\nextremely impatient to hear from you again, that I may know how Eliza\\nis, and when you are to return.\\n\\nWith best love, etc., I am affectionately yours,\\n\\n                                                  J.

Let me know how\\nmany, besides their fourteen selves and Mr. and Mrs. Wright, Michael\\nwill contrive to place about their coach, and how many of the gentlemen,\\nmusicians, and waiters he will have persuaded to come in their\\nshooting-jackets. I hope John Lovett's accident will not prevent his\\nattending the ball, as you will otherwise be obliged to dance with Mr.\\nTincton the whole evening. Let me know how J. Harwood deports himself\\nwithout the Miss Biggs, and which of the Marys will carry the day with\\nmy brother James.\\n\\n_We_ were at a ball on Saturday, I assure you. We dined at Goodnestone,\\nand in the evening danced two country-dances and the Boulangeries. I\\nopened the ball with Edward Bridges; the other couples were Lewis Cage\\nand Harriet, Frank and Louisa, Fanny and George. Elizabeth played one\\ncountry-dance, Lady Bridges the other, which she made Henry dance with\\nher, and Miss Finch played the Boulangeries.\\n\\nIn reading over the last three or four lines, I am aware of my having\\nexpressed myself in so doubtful a manner that if I did not tell you to\\nthe contrary, you might imagine it was Lady Bridges who made Henry dance\\nwith her at the same time that she was playing, which, if not\\nimpossible, must appear a very improbable event to you. But it was\\nElizabeth who danced. We supped there, and walked home at night under\\nthe shade of two umbrellas.\\n\\nTo-day the Goodnestone party begins to disperse and spread itself\\nabroad. Mr. and Mrs. Cage and George repair to Hythe. Lady Waltham, Miss\\nBridges, and Miss Mary Finch to Dover, for the health of the two former.\\nI have never seen Marianne at all. On Thursday Mr. and Mrs. Bridges\\nreturn to Danbury; Miss Harriet Hales accompanies them to London on her\\nway to Dorsetshire.\\n\\nFarmer Claringbould died this morning, and I fancy Edward means to get\\nsome of his farm, if he can cheat Sir Brook enough in the agreement.\\n\\nWe have just got some venison from Godmersham, which the two Mr. Harveys\\nare to dine on to-morrow, and on Friday or Saturday the Goodnestone\\npeople are to finish their scraps. Henry went away on Friday, as he\\npurposed, _without fayl_. You will hear from him soon, I imagine, as he\\ntalked of writing to Steventon shortly. Mr. Richard Harvey is going to\\nbe married; but as it is a great secret, and only known to half the\\nneighborhood, you must not mention it. The lady's name is Musgrave.\\n\\nI am in great distress. I cannot determine whether I shall give Richis\\nhalf a guinea or only five shillings when I go away. Counsel me, amiable\\nMiss Austen, and tell me which will be the most.\\n\\nWe walked Frank last night to Crixhall Ruff, and he appeared much\\nedified. Little Edward was breeched yesterday for good and all, and was\\nwhipped into the bargain.\\n\\nPray remember me to everybody who does not inquire after me; those who\\ndo, remember me without bidding. Give my love to Mary Harrison, and\\ntell her I wish, whenever she is attached to a young man, some\\nrespectable Dr. Marchmont may keep them apart for five volumes. . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '                                    ROWLING, Thursday (September 15).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--We have been very gay since I wrote last; dining at\\nNackington, returning by moonlight, and everything quite in style, not\\nto mention Mr. Claringbould\\'s funeral which we saw go by on Sunday. I\\nbelieve I told you in a former letter that Edward had some idea of\\ntaking the name of Claringbould; but that scheme is over, though it\\nwould be a very eligible as well as a very pleasant plan, would any one\\nadvance him money enough to begin on. We rather expected Mr. Milles to\\nhave done so on Tuesday; but to our great surprise nothing was said on\\nthe subject, and unless it is in your power to assist your brother with\\nfive or six hundred pounds, he must entirely give up the idea.\\n\\nAt Nackington we met Lady Sondes\\' picture over the mantelpiece in the\\ndining-room, and the pictures of her three children in an ante-room,\\nbesides Mr. Scott, Miss Fletcher, Mr. Toke, Mr. J. Toke, and the\\narchdeacon Lynch. Miss Fletcher and I were very thick, but I am the\\nthinnest of the two. She wore her purple muslin, which is pretty\\nenough, though it does not become her complexion. There are two traits\\nin her character which are pleasing,--namely, she admires Camilla, and\\ndrinks no cream in her tea. If you should ever see Lucy, you may tell\\nher that I scolded Miss Fletcher for her negligence in writing, as she\\ndesired me to do, but without being able to bring her to any proper\\nsense of shame,--that Miss Fletcher says, in her defence, that as\\neverybody whom Lucy knew when she was in Canterbury has now left it, she\\nhas nothing at all to write to her about. By _everybody_, I suppose Miss\\nFletcher means that a new set of officers have arrived there. But this\\nis a note of my own.\\n\\nMrs. Milles, Mr. John Toke, and in short everybody of any sensibility\\ninquired in tender strains after you, and I took an opportunity of\\nassuring Mr. J. T. that neither he nor his father need longer keep\\nthemselves single for you.\\n\\nWe went in our two carriages to Nackington; but how we divided I shall\\nleave you to surmise, merely observing that as Elizabeth and I were\\nwithout either hat or bonnet, it would not have been very convenient for\\nus to go in the chaise. We went by Bifrons, and I contemplated with a\\nmelancholy pleasure the abode of him on whom I once fondly doated. We\\ndine to-day at Goodnestone, to meet my aunt Fielding from Margate and a\\nMr. Clayton, her professed admirer--at least, so I imagine. Lady Bridges\\nhas received very good accounts of Marianne, who is already certainly\\nthe better for her bathing.\\n\\nSo His Royal Highness Sir Thomas Williams has at length sailed; the\\npapers say \"on a cruise.\" But I hope they are gone to Cork, or I shall\\nhave written in vain. Give my love to Jane, as she arrived at Steventon\\nyesterday, I dare say.\\n\\nI sent a message to Mr. Digweed from Edward in a letter to Mary Lloyd\\nwhich she ought to receive to-day; but as I know that the Harwoods are\\nnot very exact as to their letters, I may as well repeat it to you. Mr.\\nDigweed is to be informed that illness has prevented Seward\\'s coming\\nover to look at the repairs intended at the farm, but that he will come\\nas soon as he can. Mr. Digweed may also be informed, if you think\\nproper, that Mr. and Mrs. Milles are to dine here to-morrow, and that\\nMrs. Joan Knatchbull is to be asked to meet them. Mr. Richard Harvey\\'s\\nmatch is put off till he has got a better Christian name, of which he\\nhas great hopes.\\n\\nMr. Children\\'s two sons are both going to be married, John and George.\\nThey are to have one wife between them, a Miss Holwell, who belongs to\\nthe Black Hole at Calcutta. I depend on hearing from James very soon; he\\npromised me an account of the ball, and by this time he must have\\ncollected his ideas enough after the fatigue of dancing to give me one.\\n\\nEdward and Fly went out yesterday very early in a couple of shooting\\njackets, and came home like a couple of bad shots, for they killed\\nnothing at all. They are out again to-day, and are not yet returned.\\nDelightful sport! They are just come home, Edward with his two brace,\\nFrank with his two and a half. What amiable young men!\\n\\n_Friday._--Your letter and one from Henry are just come, and the\\ncontents of both accord with my scheme more than I had dared expect. In\\none particular I could wish it otherwise, for Henry is very indifferent\\nindeed. You must not expect us quite so early, however, as Wednesday,\\nthe 20th,--on that day se\\'nnight, according to our present plan, we may\\nbe with you. Frank had never any idea of going away before Monday, the\\n26th. I shall write to Miss Mason immediately, and press her returning\\nwith us, which Henry thinks very likely, and particularly eligible.\\n\\nBuy Mary Harrison\\'s gown by all means. You shall have mine for ever so\\nmuch money, though, if I am tolerably rich when I get home, I shall like\\nit very much myself.\\n\\nAs to the mode of our travelling to town, _I_ want to go in a\\nstage-coach, but Frank will not let me. As you are likely to have the\\nWilliams and Lloyds with you next week, you would hardly find room for\\nus then. If any one wants anything in town, they must send their\\ncommissions to Frank, as _I_ shall merely pass through it. The\\ntallow-chandler is Penlington, at the Crown and Beehive, Charles Street,\\nCovent Garden.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Frank has received his appointment on board the \"Captain\\nJohn Gore,\" commanded by the \"Triton,\" and will therefore be obliged to\\nbe in town on Wednesday; and though I have every disposition in the\\nworld to accompany him on that day, I cannot go on the uncertainty of\\nthe Pearsons being at home, as I should not have a place to go to in\\ncase they were from home.\\n\\nI wrote to Miss P. on Friday, and hoped to receive an answer from her\\nthis morning, which would have rendered everything smooth and easy, and\\nwould have enabled us to leave this place to-morrow, as Frank, on first\\nreceiving his appointment, intended to do. He remains till Wednesday\\nmerely to accommodate me. I have written to her again to-day, and\\ndesired her to answer it by return of post. On Tuesday, therefore, I\\nshall positively know whether they can receive me on Wednesday. If they\\ncannot, Edward has been so good as to promise to take me to Greenwich on\\nthe Monday following, which was the day before fixed on, if that suits\\nthem better. If I have no answer at all on Tuesday, I must suppose Mary\\nis not at home, and must wait till I do hear, as after having invited\\nher to go to Steventon with me, it will not quite do to go home and say\\nno more about it.\\n\\nMy father will be so good as to fetch home his prodigal daughter from\\ntown, I hope, unless he wishes me to walk the hospitals, enter at the\\nTemple, or mount guard at St. James\\'. It will hardly be in Frank\\'s power\\nto take me home,--nay, it certainly will not. I shall write again as\\nsoon as I get to Greenwich.\\n\\nWhat dreadful hot weather we have! It keeps one in a continual state of\\ninelegance.\\n\\nIf Miss Pearson should return with me, pray be careful not to expect too\\nmuch beauty. I will not pretend to say that on a first view she quite\\nanswered the opinion I had formed of her. My mother, I am sure, will be\\ndisappointed if she does not take great care. From what I remember of\\nher picture, it is no great resemblance.\\n\\nI am very glad that the idea of returning with Frank occurred to me; for\\nas to Henry\\'s coming into Kent again, the time of its taking place is so\\nvery uncertain that I should be waiting for dead men\\'s shoes. I had once\\ndetermined to go with Frank to-morrow and take my chance, etc., but they\\ndissuaded me from so rash a step as I really think on consideration it\\nwould have been; for if the Pearsons were not at home, I should\\ninevitably fall a sacrifice to the arts of some fat woman who would make\\nme drunk with small beer.\\n\\nMary is brought to bed of a boy,--both doing very well. I shall leave\\nyou to guess what Mary I mean. Adieu, with best love to all your\\nagreeable inmates. Don\\'t let the Lloyds go on any account before I\\nreturn, unless Miss P. is of the party. How ill I have written! I begin\\nto hate myself.\\n\\n                                                 Yours ever,\\n                                                          J.

I am now able to send you a\\ncontinuation of the same good account of her. She was very little\\nfatigued on her arrival at this place, has been refreshed by a\\ncomfortable dinner, and now seems quite stout. It wanted five minutes of\\ntwelve when we left Sittingbourne, from whence we had a famous pair of\\nhorses, which took us to Rochester in an hour and a quarter; the postboy\\nseemed determined to show my mother that Kentish drivers were not always\\ntedious, and really drove as fast as Cax.\\n\\nOur next stage was not quite so expeditiously performed; the road was\\nheavy, and our horses very indifferent. However, we were in such good\\ntime and my mother bore her journey so well, that expedition was of\\nlittle importance to us; and as it was, we were very little more than\\ntwo hours and a half coming hither, and it was scarcely past four when\\nwe stopped at the inn. My mother took some of her bitters at Ospringe,\\nand some more at Rochester, and she ate some bread several times.\\n\\nWe have got apartments up two pair of stairs, as we could not be\\notherwise accommodated with a sitting-room and bed-chambers on the same\\nfloor which we wished to be. We have one double-bedded and one\\nsingle-bedded room; in the former my mother and I are to sleep. I shall\\nleave you to guess who is to occupy the other. We sate down to dinner a\\nlittle after five, and had some beef-steaks and a boiled fowl, but no\\noyster sauce.\\n\\nI should have begun my letter soon after our arrival, but for a little\\nadventure which prevented me. After we had been here a quarter of an\\nhour it was discovered that my writing and dressing boxes had been by\\naccident put into a chaise which was just packing off as we came in, and\\nwere driven away toward Gravesend in their way to the West Indies. No\\npart of my property could have been such a prize before, for in my\\nwriting-box was all my worldly wealth, 7_l._, and my dear Harry\\'s\\ndeputation. Mr. Nottley immediately despatched a man and horse after the\\nchaise, and in half an hour\\'s time I had the pleasure of being as rich\\nas ever; they were got about two or three miles off.\\n\\nMy day\\'s journey has been pleasanter in every respect than I expected. I\\nhave been very little crowded and by no means unhappy. Your\\nwatchfulness with regard to the weather on our accounts was very kind\\nand very effectual. We had one heavy shower on leaving Sittingbourne,\\nbut afterwards the clouds cleared away, and we had a very bright\\n_chrystal_ afternoon.\\n\\nMy father is now reading the \"Midnight Bell,\" which he has got from the\\nlibrary, and mother sitting by the fire. Our route to-morrow is not\\ndetermined. We have none of us much inclination for London, and if Mr.\\nNottley will give us leave, I think we shall go to Staines through\\nCroydon and Kingston, which will be much pleasanter than any other way;\\nbut he is decidedly for Clapham and Battersea. God bless you all!\\n\\n                                         Yours affectionately, J. A.\\n\\nI flatter myself that _itty Dordy_ will not forget me at least under a\\nweek.

Soon after I had finished my letter from Staines, my\\nmother began to suffer from the exercise or fatigue of travelling, and\\nshe was a good deal indisposed. She had not a very good night at\\nStaines, but bore her journey better than I had expected, and at\\nBasingstoke, where we stopped more than half an hour, received much\\ncomfort from a mess of broth and the sight of Mr. Lyford, who\\nrecommended her to take twelve drops of laudanum when she went to bed as\\na composer, which she accordingly did.\\n\\nJames called on us just as we were going to tea, and my mother was well\\nenough to talk very cheerfully to him before she went to bed. James\\nseems to have taken to his old trick of coming to Steventon in spite of\\nMary\\'s reproaches, for he was here before breakfast and is now paying us\\na second visit. They were to have dined here to-day, but the weather is\\ntoo bad. I have had the pleasure of hearing that Martha is with them.\\nJames fetched her from Ibthorp on Thursday, and she will stay with them\\ntill she removes to Kintbury.\\n\\nWe met with no adventures at all in our journey yesterday, except that\\nour trunk had once nearly slipped off, and we were obliged to stop at\\nHartley to have our wheels greased.\\n\\nWhilst my mother and Mr. Lyford were together I went to Mrs. Ryder\\'s and\\nbought what I intended to buy, but not in much perfection. There were\\nno narrow braces for children, and scarcely any notting silk; but Miss\\nWood, as usual, is going to town very soon, and will lay in a fresh\\nstock. I gave 2_s._ 3_d._ a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it is not\\nvery good, but it is so disgraceful and contemptible an article in\\nitself that its being comparatively good or bad is of little importance.\\nI bought some Japan ink likewise, and next week shall begin my\\noperations on my hat, on which you know my principal hopes of happiness\\ndepend.\\n\\nI am very grand indeed; I had the dignity of dropping out my mother\\'s\\nlaudanum last night. I carry about the keys of the wine and closet, and\\ntwice since I began this letter have had orders to give in the kitchen.\\nOur dinner was very good yesterday, and the chicken boiled perfectly\\ntender; therefore I shall not be obliged to dismiss Nanny on that\\naccount.\\n\\nAlmost everything was unpacked and put away last night. Nanny chose to\\ndo it, and I was not sorry to be busy. I have unpacked the gloves, and\\nplaced yours in your drawer. Their color is light and pretty, and I\\nbelieve exactly what we fixed on.\\n\\nYour letter was chaperoned here by one from Mrs. Cooke, in which she\\nsays that \"Battleridge\" is not to come out before January, and she is so\\nlittle satisfied with Cawthorn\\'s dilatoriness that she never means to\\nemploy him again.\\n\\nMrs. Hall, of Sherborne, was brought to bed yesterday of a dead child,\\nsome weeks before she expected, owing to a fright. I suppose she\\nhappened unawares to look at her husband.\\n\\nThere has been a great deal of rain here for this last fortnight, much\\nmore than in Kent, and indeed we found the roads all the way from\\nStaines most disgracefully dirty. Steventon lane has its full share of\\nit, and I don\\'t know when I shall be able to get to Deane.\\n\\nI hear that Martha is in better looks and spirits than she has enjoyed\\nfor a long time, and I flatter myself she will now be able to jest\\nopenly about Mr. W.\\n\\nThe spectacles which Molly found are my mother\\'s, the scissors my\\nfather\\'s. We are very glad to hear such a good account of your patients,\\nlittle and great. My dear itty Dordy\\'s remembrance of me is very\\npleasing to me,--foolishly pleasing, because I know it will be over so\\nsoon. My attachment to him will be more durable. I shall think with\\ntenderness and delight on his beautiful and smiling countenance and\\ninteresting manner until a few years have turned him into an\\nungovernable, ungracious fellow.\\n\\nThe books from Winton are all unpacked and put away; the binding has\\ncompressed them most conveniently, and there is now very good room in\\nthe bookcase for all that we wish to have there. I believe the servants\\nwere very glad to see us Nanny was, I am sure. She confesses that it\\nwas very dull, and yet she had her child with her till last Sunday. I\\nunderstand that there are some grapes left, but I believe not many; they\\nmust be gathered as soon as possible, or this rain will entirely rot\\nthem.\\n\\nI am quite angry with myself for not writing closer; why is my alphabet\\nso much more sprawly than yours? Dame Tilbury\\'s daughter has lain in.\\nShall I give her any of your baby clothes? The laceman was here only a\\nfew days ago. How unfortunate for both of us that he came so soon! Dame\\nBushell washes for us only one week more, as Sukey has got a place. John\\nSteevens\\' wife undertakes our purification. She does not look as if\\nanything she touched would ever be clean, but who knows? We do not seem\\nlikely to have any other maidservant at present, but Dame Staples will\\nsupply the place of one. Mary has hired a young girl from Ashe who has\\nnever been out to service to be her scrub, but James fears her not being\\nstrong enough for the place.\\n\\nEarle Harwood has been to Deane lately, as I think Mary wrote us word,\\nand his family then told him that they would receive his wife, if she\\ncontinued to behave well for another year. He was very grateful, as well\\nhe might; their behavior throughout the whole affair has been\\nparticularly kind. Earle and his wife live in the most private manner\\nimaginable at Portsmouth, without keeping a servant of any kind. What a\\nprodigious innate love of virtue she must have, to marry under such\\ncircumstances!\\n\\nIt is now Saturday evening, but I wrote the chief of this in the\\nmorning. My mother has not been down at all to-day; the laudanum made\\nher sleep a good deal, and upon the whole I think she is better. My\\nfather and I dined by ourselves. How strange! He and John Bond are now\\nvery happy together, for I have just heard the heavy step of the latter\\nalong the passage.\\n\\nJames Digweed called to-day, and I gave him his brother\\'s deputation.\\nCharles Harwood, too, has just called to ask how we are, in his way from\\nDummer, whither he has been conveying Miss Garrett, who is going to\\nreturn to her former residence in Kent. I will leave off, or I shall not\\nhave room to add a word to-morrow.\\n\\n_Sunday._--My mother has had a very good night, and feels much better\\nto-day.\\n\\nI have received my aunt\\'s letter, and thank you for your scrap. I will\\nwrite to Charles soon. Pray give Fanny and Edward a kiss from me, and\\nask George if he has got a new song for me. \\'Tis really very kind of my\\naunt to ask us to Bath again; a kindness that deserves a better return\\nthan to profit by it.\\n\\n                                                 Yours ever,      J.

He was at Cadiz,\\nalive and well, on October 19, and had then very lately received a\\nletter from you, written as long ago as when the \"London\" was at St.\\nHelen\\'s. But his _raly_ latest intelligence of us was in one from me of\\nSeptember 1, which I sent soon after we got to Godmersham. He had\\nwritten a packet full for his dearest friends in England, early in\\nOctober, to go by the \"Excellent;\" but the \"Excellent\" was not sailed,\\nnor likely to sail, when he despatched this to me. It comprehended\\nletters for both of us, for Lord Spencer, Mr. Daysh, and the East India\\nDirectors. Lord St. Vincent had left the fleet when he wrote, and was\\ngone to Gibraltar, it was said to superintend the fitting out of a\\nprivate expedition from thence against some of the enemies\\' ports;\\nMinorca or Malta were conjectured to be the objects.\\n\\nFrank writes in good spirits, but says that our correspondence cannot be\\nso easily carried on in future as it has been, as the communication\\nbetween Cadiz and Lisbon is less frequent than formerly. You and my\\nmother, therefore, must not alarm yourselves at the long intervals that\\nmay divide his letters. I address this advice to you two as being the\\nmost tender-hearted of the family.\\n\\nMy mother made her _entrée_ into the dressing-room through crowds of\\nadmiring spectators yesterday afternoon, and we all drank tea together\\nfor the first time these five weeks. She has had a tolerable night, and\\nbids fair for a continuance in the same brilliant course of action\\nto-day. . . .\\n\\nMr. Lyford was here yesterday; he came while we were at dinner, and\\npartook of our elegant entertainment. I was not ashamed at asking him to\\nsit down to table, for we had some pease-soup, a sparerib, and a\\npudding. He wants my mother to look yellow and to throw out a rash, but\\nshe will do neither.\\n\\nI was at Deane yesterday morning. Mary was very well, but does not gain\\nbodily strength very fast. When I saw her so stout on the third and\\nsixth days, I expected to have seen her as well as ever by the end of a\\nfortnight.\\n\\nJames went to Ibthorp yesterday to see his mother and child. Letty is\\nwith Mary[3] at present, of course exceedingly happy, and in raptures\\nwith the child. Mary does not manage matters in such a way as to make me\\nwant to lay in myself. She is not tidy enough in her appearance; she has\\nno dressing-gown to sit up in; her curtains are all too thin, and\\nthings are not in that comfort and style about her which are necessary\\nto make such a situation an enviable one. Elizabeth was really a pretty\\nobject with her nice clean cap put on so tidily and her dress so\\nuniformly white and orderly. We live entirely in the dressing-room now,\\nwhich I like very much; I always feel so much more elegant in it than in\\nthe parlor.\\n\\nNo news from Kintbury yet. Eliza sports with our impatience. She was\\nvery well last Thursday. Who is Miss Maria Montresor going to marry, and\\nwhat is to become of Miss Mulcaster?\\n\\nI find great comfort in my stuff gown, but I hope you do not wear yours\\ntoo often. I have made myself two or three caps to wear of evenings\\nsince I came home, and they save me a world of torment as to\\nhairdressing, which at present gives me no trouble beyond washing and\\nbrushing, for my long hair is always plaited up out of sight, and my\\nshort hair curls well enough to want no papering. I have had it cut\\nlately by Mr. Butler.\\n\\nThere is no reason to suppose that Miss Morgan is dead after all. Mr.\\nLyford gratified us very much yesterday by his praises of my father\\'s\\nmutton, which they all think the finest that was ever ate. John Bond\\nbegins to find himself grow old, which John Bonds ought not to do, and\\nunequal to much hard work; a man is therefore hired to supply his place\\nas to labor, and John himself is to have the care of the sheep. There\\nare not more people engaged than before, I believe; only men instead of\\nboys. I fancy so at least, but you know my stupidity as to such matters.\\nLizzie Bond is just apprenticed to Miss Small, so we may hope to see her\\nable to spoil gowns in a few years.\\n\\nMy father has applied to Mr. May for an ale-house for Robert, at his\\nrequest, and to Mr. Deane, of Winchester, likewise. This was my mother\\'s\\nidea, who thought he would be proud to oblige a relation of Edward in\\nreturn for Edward\\'s accepting his money. He sent a very civil answer\\nindeed, but has no house vacant at present. May expects to have an empty\\none soon at Farnham, so perhaps Nanny may have the honor of drawing ale\\nfor the Bishop. I shall write to Frank to-morrow.\\n\\nCharles Powlett gave a dance on Thursday, to the great disturbance of\\nall his neighbors, of course, who, you know, take a most lively interest\\nin the state of his finances, and live in hopes of his being soon\\nruined.\\n\\nWe are very much disposed to like our new maid; she knows nothing of a\\ndairy, to be sure, which, in our family, is rather against her, but she\\nis to be taught it all. In short, we have felt the inconvenience of\\nbeing without a maid so long, that we are determined to like her, and\\nshe will find it a hard matter to displease us. As yet, she seems to\\ncook very well, is uncommonly stout, and says she can work well at her\\nneedle.\\n\\n_Sunday._--My father is glad to hear so good an account of Edward\\'s\\npigs, and desires he may be told, as encouragement to his taste for\\nthem, that Lord Bolton is particularly curious in _his_ pigs, has had\\npigstyes of a most elegant construction built for them, and visits them\\nevery morning as soon as he rises.\\n\\n                                             Affectionately yours,\\n                                                                 J.

You are very welcome to my father's name and to his services\\nif they are ever required in it. I shall keep my ten pounds too, to wrap\\nmyself up in next winter.\\n\\nI took the liberty a few days ago of asking your black velvet bonnet to\\nlend me its cawl, which it very readily did, and by which I have been\\nenabled to give a considerable improvement of dignity to cap, which was\\nbefore too _nidgetty_ to please me. I shall wear it on Thursday, but I\\nhope you will not be offended with me for following your advice as to\\nits ornaments only in part. I still venture to retain the narrow silver\\nround it, put twice round without any bow, and instead of the black\\nmilitary feather shall put in the coquelicot one as being smarter, and\\nbesides coquelicot is to be all the fashion this winter. After the ball\\nI shall probably make it entirely black.\\n\\nI am sorry that our dear Charles begins to feel the dignity of\\nill-usage. My father will write to Admiral Gambier. He must have already\\nreceived so much satisfaction from his acquaintance and patronage of\\nFrank, that he will be delighted, I dare say, to have another of the\\nfamily introduced to him. I think it would be very right in Charles to\\naddress Sir Thomas on the occasion, though I cannot approve of your\\nscheme of writing to him (which you communicated to me a few nights ago)\\nto request him to come home and convey you to Steventon. To do you\\njustice, however, you had some doubts of the propriety of such a measure\\nyourself.\\n\\nI am very much obliged to my dear little George for his message,--for\\nhis love at least; his duty, I suppose, was only in consequence of some\\nhint of my favorable intentions towards him from his father or mother. I\\nam sincerely rejoiced, however, that I ever was born, since it has been\\nthe means of procuring him a dish of tea. Give my best love to him. . . .\\n\\n_Wednesday._--I have changed my mind, and changed the trimmings of my\\ncap this morning; they are now such as you suggested. I felt as if I\\nshould not prosper if I strayed from your directions, and I think it\\nmakes me look more like Lady Conyngham now than it did before, which is\\nall that one lives for now. I believe I _shall_ make my new gown like my\\nrobe, but the back of the latter is all in a piece with the tail, and\\nwill seven yards enable me to copy it in that respect? . . .\\n\\nI have just heard from Martha and Frank: his letter was written on\\nNovember 12. All well and nothing particular.\\n\\n                                                 J. A.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '                                STEVENTON, Monday night (December 24).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I have got some pleasant news for you which I am\\neager to communicate, and therefore begin my letter sooner, though I\\nshall not send it sooner than usual.\\n\\nAdmiral Gambier, in reply to my father\\'s application, writes as follows:\\n\"As it is usual to keep young officers in small vessels, it being most\\nproper on account of their inexperience, and it being also a situation\\nwhere they are more in the way of learning their duty, your son has been\\ncontinued in the \\'Scorpion;\\' but I have mentioned to the Board of\\nAdmiralty his wish to be in a frigate, and when a proper opportunity\\noffers and it is judged that he has taken his turn in a small ship, I\\nhope he will be removed. With regard to your son now in the \\'London\\' I\\nam glad I can give you the assurance that his promotion is likely to\\ntake place very soon, as Lord Spencer has been so good as to say he\\nwould include him in an arrangement that he proposes making in a short\\ntime relative to some promotions in that quarter.\"\\n\\nThere! I may now finish my letter and go and hang myself, for I am sure\\nI can neither write nor do anything which will not appear insipid to you\\nafter this. _Now_ I really think he will soon be made, and only wish we\\ncould communicate our foreknowledge of the event to him whom it\\nprincipally concerns. My father has written to Daysh to desire that he\\nwill inform us, if he can, when the commission is sent. Your chief wish\\nis now ready to be accomplished; and could Lord Spencer give happiness\\nto Martha at the same time, what a joyful heart he would make of yours!\\n\\nI have sent the same extract of the sweets of Gambier to Charles, who,\\npoor fellow, though he sinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the\\nhero of the piece, will, I hope, be contented with the prospect held out\\nto him. By what the Admiral says, it appears as if he had been\\ndesignedly kept in the \"Scorpion.\" But I will not torment myself with\\nconjectures and suppositions; facts shall satisfy me.\\n\\nFrank had not heard from any of us for ten weeks when he wrote to me on\\nNovember 12 in consequence of Lord St. Vincent being removed to\\nGibraltar. When his commission is sent, however, it will not be so long\\non its road as our letters, because all the Government despatches are\\nforwarded by land to his lordship from Lisbon with great regularity.\\n\\nI returned from Manydown this morning, and found my mother certainly in\\nno respect worse than when I left her. She does not like the cold\\nweather, but that we cannot help. I spent my time very quietly and very\\npleasantly with Catherine. Miss Blackford is agreeable enough. I do not\\nwant people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking\\nthem a great deal. I found only Catherine and her when I got to Manydown\\non Thursday. We dined together, and went together to Worting to seek the\\nprotection of Mrs. Clarke, with whom were Lady Mildmay, her eldest son,\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Hoare.\\n\\nOur ball was very thin, but by no means unpleasant. There were\\nthirty-one people, and only eleven ladies out of the number, and but\\nfive single women in the room. Of the gentlemen present you may have\\nsome idea from the list of my partners,--Mr. Wood, G. Lefroy, Rice, a\\nMr. Butcher (belonging to the Temples, a sailor and not of the 11th\\nLight Dragoons), Mr. Temple (not the horrid one of all), Mr. Wm. Orde\\n(cousin to the Kingsclere man), Mr. John Harwood, and Mr. Calland, who\\nappeared as usual with his hat in his hand, and stood every now and then\\nbehind Catherine and me to be talked to and abused for not dancing. We\\nteased him, however, into it at last. I was very glad to see him again\\nafter so long a separation, and he was altogether rather the genius and\\nflirt of the evening. He inquired after you.\\n\\nThere were twenty dances, and I danced them all, and without any\\nfatigue. I was glad to find myself capable of dancing so much, and with\\nso much satisfaction as I did; from my slender enjoyment of the Ashford\\nballs (as assemblies for dancing) I had not thought myself equal to it,\\nbut in cold weather and with few couples I fancy I could just as well\\ndance for a week together as for half an hour. My black cap was openly\\nadmired by Mrs. Lefroy, and secretly I imagine by everybody else in the\\nroom. . . .\\n\\nPoor Edward! It is very hard that he, who has everything else in the\\nworld that he can wish for, should not have good health too. But I hope\\nwith the assistance of stomach complaints, faintnesses, and sicknesses,\\nhe will soon be restored to that blessing likewise. If his nervous\\ncomplaint proceeded from a suppression of something that ought to be\\nthrown out, which does not seem unlikely, the first of these disorders\\nmay really be a remedy, and I sincerely wish it may, for I know no one\\nmore deserving of happiness without alloy than Edward is. . . .\\n\\nThe Lords of the Admiralty will have enough of our applications at\\npresent, for I hear from Charles that he has written to Lord Spencer\\nhimself to be removed. I am afraid his Serene Highness will be in a\\npassion, and order some of our heads to be cut off. . . .\\n\\nYou deserve a longer letter than this; but it is my unhappy fate seldom\\nto treat people so well as they deserve. . . . God bless you!\\n\\n                                         Yours affectionately,\\n                                                          JANE AUSTEN.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--The snow came to nothing yesterday, so I did go to Deane,\\nand returned home at nine o\\'clock at night in the little carriage, and\\nwithout being very cold.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

He was yesterday raised to the rank\\nof Commander, and appointed to the \"Petterel\" sloop, now at Gibraltar. A\\nletter from Daysh has just announced this, and as it is confirmed by a\\nvery friendly one from Mr. Mathew to the same effect, transcribing one\\nfrom Admiral Gambier to the General, we have no reason to suspect the\\ntruth of it.\\n\\nAs soon as you have cried a little for joy, you may go on, and learn\\nfurther that the India House have taken _Captain Austen\\'s_ petition into\\nconsideration,--this comes from Daysh,--and likewise that Lieutenant\\nCharles John Austen is removed to the \"Tamar\" frigate,--this comes from\\nthe Admiral. We cannot find out where the \"Tamar\" is, but I hope we\\nshall now see Charles here at all events.\\n\\nThis letter is to be dedicated entirely to good news. If you will send\\nmy father an account of your washing and letter expenses, etc., he will\\nsend you a draft for the amount of it, as well as for your next quarter,\\nand for Edward\\'s rent. If you don\\'t buy a muslin gown now on the\\nstrength of this money and Frank\\'s promotion, I shall never forgive\\nyou.\\n\\nMrs. Lefroy has just sent me word that Lady Dorchester meant to invite\\nme to her ball on January 8, which, though an humble blessing compared\\nwith what the last page records, I do not consider as any calamity.\\n\\nI cannot write any more now, but I have written enough to make you very\\nhappy, and therefore may safely conclude.\\n\\n                                     Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Godmersham Park.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                              STEVENTON, Tuesday (January 8, 1799).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You must read your letters over _five_ times in\\nfuture before you send them, and then, perhaps, you may find them as\\nentertaining as I do. I laughed at several parts of the one which I am\\nnow answering.\\n\\nCharles is not come yet, but he must come this morning, or he shall\\nnever know what I will do to him. The ball at Kempshott is this evening,\\nand I have got him an invitation, though I have not been so considerate\\nas to get him a partner. But the cases are different between him and\\nEliza Bailey, for he is not in a dying way, and may therefore be equal\\nto getting a partner for himself. I believe I told you that Monday was\\nto be the ball night, for which, and for all other errors into which I\\nmay ever have led you, I humbly ask your pardon.\\n\\nElizabeth is very cruel about my writing music, and, as a punishment for\\nher, I should insist upon always writing out all hers for her in future,\\nif I were not punishing myself at the same time.\\n\\nI am tolerably glad to hear that Edward\\'s income is so good a one,--as\\nglad as I can be at anybody\\'s being rich except you and me,--and I am\\nthoroughly rejoiced to hear of his present to you.\\n\\nI am not to wear my white satin cap to-night, after all; I am to wear a\\nmamalone cap instead, which Charles Fowle sent to Mary, and which she\\nlends me. It is all the fashion now; worn at the opera, and by Lady\\nMildmays at Hackwood balls. I hate describing such things, and I dare\\nsay you will be able to guess what it is like. I have got over the\\ndreadful epocha of mantua-making much better than I expected. My gown is\\nmade very much like my blue one, which you always told me sat very well,\\nwith only these variations: the sleeves are short, the wrap fuller, the\\napron comes over it, and a band of the same completes the whole.\\n\\nI assure you that I dread the idea of going to Brighton as much as you\\ndo, but I am not without hopes that something may happen to prevent it.\\n\\nF---- has lost his election at B----, and perhaps they may not be able\\nto see company for some time. They talk of going to Bath, too, in the\\nspring, and perhaps they may be overturned in their way down, and all\\nlaid up for the summer.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--I have had a cold and weakness in one of my eyes for some\\ndays, which makes writing neither very pleasant nor very profitable, and\\nwhich will probably prevent my finishing this letter myself. My mother\\nhas undertaken to do it for me, and I shall leave the Kempshott ball for\\nher.\\n\\nYou express so little anxiety about my being murdered under Ash Park\\nCopse by Mrs. Hulbert\\'s servant, that I have a great mind not to tell\\nyou whether I was or not, and shall only say that I did not return home\\nthat night or the next, as Martha kindly made room for me in her bed,\\nwhich was the shut-up one in the new nursery. Nurse and the child slept\\nupon the floor, and there we all were in some confusion and great\\ncomfort. The bed did exceedingly well for us, both to lie awake in and\\ntalk till two o\\'clock, and to sleep in the rest of the night. I love\\nMartha better than ever, and I mean to go and see her, if I can, when\\nshe gets home. We all dined at the Harwoods\\' on Thursday, and the party\\nbroke up the next morning.\\n\\nThis complaint in my eye has been a sad bore to me, for I have not been\\nable to read or work in any comfort since Friday; but one advantage\\nwill be derived from it, for I shall be such a proficient in music by\\nthe time I have got rid of my cold, that I shall be perfectly qualified\\nin that science at least to take Mr. Roope\\'s office at Eastwell next\\nsummer; and I am sure of Elizabeth\\'s recommendation, be it only on\\nHarriet\\'s account. Of my talent in drawing I have given specimens in my\\nletters to you, and I have nothing to do but to invent a few hard names\\nfor the stars.\\n\\nMary grows rather more reasonable about her child\\'s beauty, and says\\nthat she does not think him really handsome; but I suspect her\\nmoderation to be something like that of W---- W----\\'s mamma. Perhaps\\nMary has told you that they are going to enter more into dinner-parties;\\nthe Biggs and Mr. Holder dine there to-morrow, and I am to meet them. I\\nshall sleep there. Catherine has the honor of giving her name to a set,\\nwhich will be composed of two Withers, two Heathcotes, a Blackford, and\\nno Bigg except herself. She congratulated me last night on Frank\\'s\\npromotion, as if she really felt the joy she talked of.\\n\\nMy sweet little George! I am delighted to hear that he has such an\\ninventive genius as to face-making. I admired his yellow wafer very\\nmuch, and hope he will choose the wafer for your next letter. I wore my\\ngreen shoes last night, and took my white fan with me; I am very glad he\\nnever threw it into the river.\\n\\nMrs. Knight giving up the Godmersham estate to Edward was no such\\nprodigious act of generosity after all, it seems, for she has reserved\\nherself an income out of it still; this ought to be known, that her\\nconduct may not be overrated. I rather think Edward shows the most\\nmagnanimity of the two, in accepting her resignation with such\\nincumbrances.\\n\\nThe more I write, the better my eye gets; so I shall at least keep on\\ntill it is quite well, before I give up my pen to my mother.\\n\\nMrs. Bramston\\'s little movable apartment was tolerably filled last night\\nby herself, Mrs. H. Blackstone, her two daughters, and me. I do not like\\nthe Miss Blackstones; indeed, I was always determined not to like them,\\nso there is the less merit in it. Mrs. Bramston was very civil, kind,\\nand noisy. I spent a very pleasant evening, chiefly among the Manydown\\nparty. There was the same kind of supper as last year, and the same want\\nof chairs. There were more dancers than the room could conveniently\\nhold, which is enough to constitute a good ball at any time.\\n\\nI do not think I was very much in request. People were rather apt not to\\nask me till they could not help it; one\\'s consequence, you know, varies\\nso much at times without any particular reason. There was one gentleman,\\nan officer of the Cheshire, a very good-looking young man, who, I was\\ntold, wanted very much to be introduced to me; but as he did not want\\nit quite enough to take much trouble in effecting it, we never could\\nbring it about.\\n\\nI danced with Mr. John Wood again, twice with a Mr. South, a lad from\\nWinchester, who, I suppose, is as far from being related to the bishop\\nof that diocese as it is possible to be, with G. Lefroy, and J. Harwood,\\nwho, I think, takes to me rather more than he used to do. One of my\\ngayest actions was sitting down two dances in preference to having Lord\\nBolton\\'s eldest son for my partner, who danced too ill to be endured.\\nThe Miss Charterises were there, and played the parts of the Miss Edens\\nwith great spirit. Charles never came. Naughty Charles! I suppose he\\ncould not get superseded in time.\\n\\nMiss Debary has replaced your two sheets of drawing-paper with two of\\nsuperior size and quality; so I do not grudge her having taken them at\\nall now. Mr. Ludlow and Miss Pugh of Andover are lately married, and so\\nis Mrs. Skeete of Basingstoke, and Mr. French, chemist, of Reading.\\n\\nI do not wonder at your wanting to read \"First Impressions\" again, so\\nseldom as you have gone through it, and that so long ago. I am much\\nobliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you. I have\\nlong secretly wished it might be done, but had not courage to make the\\nrequest.\\n\\nPray mention the name of Maria Montresor\\'s lover when you write next. My\\nmother wants to know it, and I have not courage to look back into your\\nletters to find it out.\\n\\nI shall not be able to send this till to-morrow, and you will be\\ndisappointed on Friday; I am very sorry for it, but I cannot help it.\\n\\nThe partnership between Jeffereys, Toomer, and Legge is dissolved; the\\ntwo latter are melted away into nothing, and it is to be hoped that\\nJeffereys will soon break, for the sake of a few heroines whose money he\\nmay have. I wish you joy of your birthday twenty times over.\\n\\nI shall be able to send this to the post to-day, which exalts me to the\\nutmost pinnacle of human felicity, and makes me bask in the sunshine of\\nprosperity or gives me any other sensation of pleasure in studied\\nlanguage which you may prefer. Do not be angry with me for not filling\\nmy sheet, and believe me yours affectionately,\\n\\n                                                 J.

       " '                                    STEVENTON, Monday (January 21).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I will endeavor to make this letter more worthy your\\nacceptance than my last, which was so shabby a one that I think Mr.\\nMarshall could never charge you with the postage. My eyes have been\\nvery indifferent since it was written, but are now getting better once\\nmore; keeping them so many hours open on Thursday night, as well as the\\ndust of the ballroom, injured them a good deal. I use them as little as\\nI can, but you know, and Elizabeth knows, and everybody who ever had\\nweak eyes knows, how delightful it is to hurt them by employment,\\nagainst the advice and entreaty of all one\\'s friends.\\n\\nCharles leaves us to-night. The \"Tamar\" is in the Downs, and Mr. Daysh\\nadvises him to join her there directly, as there is no chance of her\\ngoing to the westward. Charles does not approve of this at all, and will\\nnot be much grieved if he should be too late for her before she sails,\\nas he may then hope to get into a better station. He attempted to go to\\ntown last night, and got as far on his road thither as Dean Gate; but\\nboth the coaches were full, and we had the pleasure of seeing him back\\nagain. He will call on Daysh to-morrow to know whether the \"Tamar\" has\\nsailed or not, and if she is still at the Downs he will proceed in one\\nof the night coaches to Deal. I want to go with him, that I may explain\\nthe country to him properly between Canterbury and Rowling, but the\\nunpleasantness of returning by myself deters me. I should like to go as\\nfar as Ospringe with him very much indeed, that I might surprise you at\\nGodmersham.\\n\\nMartha writes me word that Charles was very much admired at Kintbury,\\nand Mrs. Lefroy never saw any one so much improved in her life, and\\nthinks him handsomer than Henry. He appears to far more advantage here\\nthan he did at Godmersham, not surrounded by strangers and neither\\noppressed by a pain in his face or powder in his hair.\\n\\nJames christened Elizabeth Caroline on Saturday morning, and then came\\nhome. Mary, Anna, and Edward have left us of course; before the second\\nwent I took down her answer to her cousin Fanny.\\n\\nYesterday came a letter to my mother from Edward Cooper to announce, not\\nthe birth of a child, but of a living; for Mrs. Leigh has begged his\\nacceptance of the Rectory of Hamstall-Ridware in Staffordshire, vacant\\nby Mr. Johnson\\'s death. We collect from his letter that he means to\\nreside there, in which he shows his wisdom. Staffordshire is a good way\\noff; so we shall see nothing more of them till, some fifteen years\\nhence, the Miss Coopers are presented to us, fine, jolly, handsome,\\nignorant girls. The living is valued at 140_l._ a year, but perhaps it\\nmay be improvable. How will they be able to convey the furniture of the\\ndressing-room so far in safety?\\n\\nOur first cousins seem all dropping off very fast. One is incorporated\\ninto the family, another dies, and a third goes into Staffordshire. We\\ncan learn nothing of the disposal of the other living. I have not the\\nsmallest notion of Fulwar\\'s having it. Lord Craven has probably other\\nconnections and more intimate ones, in that line, than he now has with\\nthe Kintbury family.\\n\\nOur ball on Thursday was a very poor one, only eight couple and but\\ntwenty-three people in the room; but it was not the ball\\'s fault, for we\\nwere deprived of two or three families by the sudden illness of Mr.\\nWither, who was seized that morning at Winchester with a return of his\\nformer alarming complaint. An express was sent off from thence to the\\nfamily; Catherine and Miss Blackford were dining with Mrs. Russell. Poor\\nCatherine\\'s distress must have been very great. She was prevailed on to\\nwait till the Heathcotes could come from Wintney, and then with those\\ntwo and Harris proceeded directly to Winchester. In such a disorder his\\ndanger, I suppose, must always be great; but from this attack he is now\\nrapidly recovering, and will be well enough to return to Manydown, I\\nfancy, in a few days.\\n\\nIt was a fine thing for conversation at the ball. But it deprived us not\\nonly of the Biggs, but of Mrs. Russell too, and of the Boltons and John\\nHarwood, who were dining there likewise, and of Mr. Lane, who kept away\\nas related to the family. Poor man!--I mean Mr. Wither--his life is so\\nuseful, his character so respectable and worthy, that I really believe\\nthere was a good deal of sincerity in the general concern expressed on\\nhis account.\\n\\nOur ball was chiefly made up of Jervoises and Terrys, the former of whom\\nwere apt to be vulgar, the latter to be noisy. I had an odd set of\\npartners: Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Street, Colonel Jervoise, James Digweed, J.\\nLyford, and Mr. Briggs, a friend of the latter. I had a very pleasant\\nevening, however, though you will probably find out that there was no\\nparticular reason for it; but I do not think it worth while to wait for\\nenjoyment until there is some real opportunity for it. Mary behaved very\\nwell, and was not at all fidgetty. For the history of her adventures at\\nthe ball I refer you to Anna\\'s letter.\\n\\nWhen you come home you will have some shirts to make up for Charles.\\nMrs. Davies frightened him into buying a piece of Irish when we were in\\nBasingstoke. Mr. Daysh supposes that Captain Austen\\'s commission has\\nreached him by this time.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--Your letter has pleased and amused me very much. Your essay\\non happy fortnights is highly ingenious, and the talobert skin made me\\nlaugh a good deal. Whenever I fall into misfortune, how many jokes it\\nought to furnish to my acquaintance in general, or I shall die\\ndreadfully in their debt for entertainment.\\n\\nIt began to occur to me before you mentioned it that I had been\\nsomewhat silent as to my mother\\'s health for some time, but I thought\\nyou could have no difficulty in divining its exact state,--you, who have\\nguessed so much stranger things. She is tolerably well,--better upon the\\nwhole than she was some weeks ago. She would tell you herself that she\\nhas a very dreadful cold in her head at present; but I have not much\\ncompassion for colds in the head without fever or sore throat.\\n\\nOur own particular little brother got a place in the coach last night,\\nand is now, I suppose, in town. I have no objection at all to your\\nbuying our gowns there, as your imagination has pictured to you exactly\\nsuch a one as is necessary to make me happy. You quite abash me by your\\nprogress in notting, for I am still without silk. You must get me some\\nin town or in Canterbury; it should be finer than yours.\\n\\nI thought Edward would not approve of Charles being a crop, and rather\\nwished you to conceal it from him at present, lest it might fall on his\\nspirits and retard his recovery. My father furnishes him with a pig from\\nCheesedown; it is already killed and cut up, but it is not to weigh more\\nthan nine stone; the season is too far advanced to get him a larger one.\\nMy mother means to pay herself for the salt and the trouble of ordering\\nit to be cured by the spareribs, the souse, and the lard.

       " \"                                    13 QUEEN'S SQUARE, Friday (May 17).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Our journey yesterday went off exceedingly well;\\nnothing occurred to alarm or delay us. We found the roads in excellent\\norder, had very good horses all the way, and reached Devizes with ease\\nby four o'clock. I suppose John has told you in what manner we were\\ndivided when we left Andover, and no alteration was afterwards made. At\\nDevizes we had comfortable rooms and a good dinner, to which we sat down\\nabout five; amongst other things we had asparagus and a lobster, which\\nmade me wish for you, and some cheesecakes, on which the children made\\nso delightful a supper as to endear the town of Devizes to them for a\\nlong time.\\n\\nWell, here we are at Bath; we got here about one o'clock, and have been\\narrived just long enough to go over the house, fix on our rooms, and be\\nvery well pleased with the whole of it. Poor Elizabeth has had a dismal\\nride of it from Devizes, for it has rained almost all the way, and our\\nfirst view of Bath has been just as gloomy as it was last November\\ntwelvemonth.\\n\\nI have got so many things to say, so many things equally important, that\\nI know not on which to decide at present, and shall therefore go and eat\\nwith the children.\\n\\nWe stopped in Paragon as we came along, but as it was too wet and dirty\\nfor us to get out, we could only see Frank, who told us that his master\\nwas very indifferent, but had had a better night last night than usual.\\nIn Paragon we met Mrs. Foley and Mrs. Dowdeswell with her yellow shawl\\nairing out, and at the bottom of Kingsdown Hill we met a gentleman in a\\nbuggy, who, on minute examination, turned out to be Dr. Hall--and Dr.\\nHall in such very deep mourning that either his mother, his wife, or\\nhimself must be dead. These are all of our acquaintance who have yet met\\nour eyes.\\n\\nI have some hopes of being plagued about my trunk; I had more a few\\nhours ago, for it was too heavy to go by the coach which brought Thomas\\nand Rebecca from Devizes; there was reason to suppose that it might be\\ntoo heavy likewise for any other coach, and for a long time we could\\nhear of no wagon to convey it. At last, however, we unluckily discovered\\nthat one was just on the point of setting out for this place, but at any\\nrate the trunk cannot be here till to-morrow; so far we are safe, and\\nwho knows what may not happen to procure a further delay?\\n\\nI put Mary's letter into the post-office at Andover with my own hand.\\n\\nWe are exceedingly pleased with the house; the rooms are quite as large\\nas we expected. Mrs. Bromley is a fat woman in mourning, and a little\\nblack kitten runs about the staircase. Elizabeth has the apartment\\nwithin the drawing-room; she wanted my mother to have it, but as there\\nwas no bed in the inner one, and the stairs are so much easier of\\nascent, or my mother so much stronger than in Paragon as not to regard\\nthe double flight, it is settled for us to be above, where we have two\\nvery nice-sized rooms, with dirty quilts and everything comfortable. I\\nhave the outward and larger apartment, as I ought to have; which is\\nquite as large as our bedroom at home, and my mother's is not materially\\nless. The beds are both as large as any at Steventon, and I have a very\\nnice chest of drawers and a closet full of shelves,--so full indeed that\\nthere is nothing else in it, and it should therefore be called a\\ncupboard rather than a closet, I suppose.\\n\\nTell Mary that there were some carpenters at work in the inn at Devizes\\nthis morning, but as I could not be sure of their being Mrs. W. Fowle's\\nrelations, I did not make myself known to them.\\n\\nI hope it will be a tolerable afternoon. When first we came, all the\\numbrellas were up, but now the pavements are getting very white again.\\n\\nMy mother does not seem at all the worse for her journey, nor are any of\\nus, I hope, though Edward seemed rather fagged last night, and not very\\nbrisk this morning; but I trust the bustle of sending for tea, coffee,\\nand sugar, etc., and going out to taste a cheese himself, will do him\\ngood.\\n\\nThere was a very long list of arrivals here in the newspaper yesterday,\\nso that we need not immediately dread absolute solitude; and there is a\\npublic breakfast in Sydney Gardens every morning, so that we shall not\\nbe wholly starved.\\n\\nElizabeth has just had a very good account of the three little boys. I\\nhope you are very busy and very comfortable. I find no difficulty in\\nclosing my eyes. I like our situation very much; it is far more cheerful\\nthan Paragon, and the prospect from the drawing-room window, at which I\\nnow write, is rather picturesque, as it commands a prospective view of\\nthe left side of Brock Street, broken by three Lombardy poplars in the\\ngarden of the last house in Queen's Parade.\\n\\nI am rather impatient to know the fate of my best gown, but I suppose it\\nwill be some days before Frances can get through the trunk. In the mean\\ntime I am, with many thanks for your trouble in making it, as well as\\nmarking my silk stockings,\\n\\n                                    Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                            JANE.\\n\\nA great deal of love from everybody.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

As I have written to her since the time which\\nought to have brought me hers, I suppose she will consider herself, as I\\nchoose to consider her, still in my debt.\\n\\nI will lay out all the little judgment I have in endeavoring to get such\\nstockings for Anna as she will approve; but I do not know that I shall\\nexecute Martha\\'s commission at all, for I am not fond of ordering shoes;\\nand, at any rate, they shall all have flat heels.\\n\\nWhat must I tell you of Edward? Truth or falsehood? I will try the\\nformer, and you may choose for yourself another time. He was better\\nyesterday than he had been for two or three days before,--about as well\\nas while he was at Steventon. He drinks at the Hetling Pump, is to bathe\\nto-morrow, and try electricity on Tuesday. He proposed the latter\\nhimself to Dr. Fellowes, who made no objection to it, but I fancy we are\\nall unanimous in expecting no advantage from it. At present I have no\\ngreat notion of our staying here beyond the month.\\n\\nI heard from Charles last week; they were to sail on Wednesday.\\n\\nMy mother seems remarkably well. My uncle overwalked himself at first,\\nand can now only travel in a chair, but is otherwise very well.\\n\\nMy cloak is come home. I like it very much, and can now exclaim with\\ndelight, like J. Bond at hay-harvest, \"This is what I have been looking\\nfor these three years.\" I saw some gauzes in a shop in Bath Street\\nyesterday at only 4_d._ a yard, but they were not so good or so pretty\\nas mine. Flowers are very much worn, and fruit is still more the thing.\\nElizabeth has a bunch of strawberries, and I have seen grapes, cherries,\\nplums, and apricots. There are likewise almonds and raisins, French\\nplums, and tamarinds at the grocers\\', but I have never seen any of them\\nin hats. A plum or greengage would cost three shillings; cherries and\\ngrapes about five, I believe, but this is at some of the dearest shops.\\nMy aunt has told me of a very cheap one, near Walcot Church, to which I\\nshall go in quest of something for you. I have never seen an old woman\\nat the pump-room.\\n\\nElizabeth has given me a hat, and it is not only a pretty hat, but a\\npretty style of hat too. It is something like Eliza\\'s, only, instead of\\nbeing all straw, half of it is narrow purple ribbon. I flatter myself,\\nhowever, that you can understand very little of it from this\\ndescription. Heaven forbid that I should ever offer such encouragement\\nto explanations as to give a clear one on any occasion myself! But I\\nmust write no more of this. . . .\\n\\nI spent Friday evening with the Mapletons, and was obliged to submit to\\nbeing pleased in spite of my inclination. We took a very charming walk\\nfrom six to eight up Beacon Hill, and across some fields, to the village\\nof Charlecombe, which is sweetly situated in a little green valley, as a\\nvillage with such a name ought to be. Marianne is sensible and\\nintelligent; and even Jane, considering how fair she is, is not\\nunpleasant. We had a Miss North and a Mr. Gould of our party; the latter\\nwalked home with me after tea. He is a very young man, just entered\\nOxford, wears spectacles, and has heard that \"Evelina\" was written by\\nDr. Johnson.\\n\\nI am afraid I cannot undertake to carry Martha\\'s shoes home, for, though\\nwe had plenty of room in our trunks when we came, we shall have many\\nmore things to take back, and I must allow besides for my packing.\\n\\nThere is to be a grand gala on Tuesday evening in Sydney Gardens, a\\nconcert, with illuminations and fireworks. To the latter Elizabeth and I\\nlook forward with pleasure, and even the concert will have more than\\nits usual charm for me, as the gardens are large enough for me to get\\npretty well beyond the reach of its sound. In the morning Lady\\nWilloughby is to present the colors to some corps, or Yeomanry, or\\nother, in the Crescent, and that such festivities may have a proper\\ncommencement, we think of going to. . . .\\n\\nI am quite pleased with Martha and Mrs. Lefroy for wanting the pattern\\nof our caps, but I am not so well pleased with your giving it to them.\\nSome wish, some prevailing wish, is necessary to the animation of\\neverybody\\'s mind, and in gratifying this you leave them to form some\\nother which will not probably be half so innocent. I shall not forget to\\nwrite to Frank. Duty and love, etc.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\n\\nMy uncle is quite surprised at my hearing from you so often; but as long\\nas we can keep the frequency of our correspondence from Martha\\'s uncle,\\nwe will not fear our own.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                                13 QUEEN SQUARE, Tuesday (June 11).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter yesterday made me very happy. I am\\nheartily glad that you have escaped any share in the impurities of\\nDeane, and not sorry, as it turns out, that our stay here has been\\nlengthened. I feel tolerably secure of our getting away next week,\\nthough it is certainly possible that we may remain till Thursday the\\n27th. I wonder what we shall do with all our intended visits this\\nsummer! I should like to make a compromise with Adlestrop, Harden, and\\nBookham, that Martha\\'s spending the summer at Steventon should be\\nconsidered as our respective visits to them all.\\n\\nEdward has been pretty well for this last week, and as the waters have\\nnever disagreed with him in any respect, we are inclined to hope that he\\nwill derive advantage from them in the end. Everybody encourages us in\\nthis expectation, for they all say that the effect of the waters cannot\\nbe negative, and many are the instances in which their benefit is felt\\nafterwards more than on the spot. He is more comfortable here than I\\nthought he would be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will both, I\\nbelieve, be very glad to get away--the latter especially, which one\\ncan\\'t wonder at somehow. So much for Mrs. Piozzi. I had some thoughts of\\nwriting the whole of my letter in her style, but I believe I shall not.\\n\\nThough you have given me unlimited powers concerning your sprig, I\\ncannot determine what to do about it, and shall therefore in this and in\\nevery other future letter continue to ask your further directions. We\\nhave been to the cheap shop, and very cheap we found it, but there are\\nonly flowers made there, no fruit; and as I could get four or five very\\npretty sprigs of the former for the same money which would procure only\\none Orleans plum--in short, could get more for three or four shillings\\nthan I could have means of bringing home--I cannot decide on the fruit\\ntill I hear from you again. Besides, I cannot help thinking that it is\\nmore natural to have flowers grow out of the head than fruit. What do\\nyou think on that subject?\\n\\nI would not let Martha read \"First Impressions\"[4] again upon any\\naccount, and am very glad that I did not leave it in your power. She is\\nvery cunning, but I saw through her design; she means to publish it from\\nmemory, and one more perusal must enable her to do it. As for\\n\"Fitzalbini,\" when I get home she shall have it, as soon as ever she\\nwill own that Mr. Elliott is handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair men are\\npreferable to black; for I mean to take every opportunity of rooting out\\nher prejudices.\\n\\nBenjamin Portal is here. How charming that is! I do not exactly know\\nwhy, but the phrase followed so naturally that I could not help putting\\nit down. My mother saw him the other day, but without making herself\\nknown to him.\\n\\nI am very glad you liked my lace, and so are you, and so is Martha, and\\nwe are all glad together. I have got your cloak home, which is quite\\ndelightful,--as delightful at least as half the circumstances which are\\ncalled so.\\n\\nI do not know what is the matter with me to-day, but I cannot write\\nquietly; I am always wandering away into some exclamation or other.\\nFortunately I have nothing very particular to say.\\n\\nWe walked to Weston one evening last week, and liked it very much. Liked\\nwhat very much? Weston? No, walking to Weston. I have not expressed\\nmyself properly, but I hope you will understand me.\\n\\nWe have not been to any public place lately, nor performed anything out\\nof the common daily routine of No. 13 Queen Square, Bath. But to-day we\\nwere to have dashed away at a very extraordinary rate, by dining out,\\nhad it not so happened that we did not go.\\n\\nEdward renewed his acquaintance lately with Mr. Evelyn, who lives in the\\nQueen\\'s Parade, and was invited to a family dinner, which I believe at\\nfirst Elizabeth was rather sorry at his accepting; but yesterday Mrs.\\nEvelyn called on us, and her manners were so pleasing that we liked the\\nidea of going very much. The Biggs would call her a nice woman. But Mr.\\nEvelyn, who was indisposed yesterday, is worse to-day, and we are put\\noff.\\n\\nIt is rather impertinent to suggest any household care to a housekeeper,\\nbut I just venture to say that the coffee-mill will be wanted every day\\nwhile Edward is at Steventon, as he always drinks coffee for breakfast.\\n\\nFanny desires her love to you, her love to grandpapa, her love to Anna,\\nand her love to Hannah; the latter is particularly to be remembered.\\nEdward desires his love to you, to grandpapa, to Anna, to little Edward,\\nto Aunt James and Uncle James, and he hopes all your turkeys and ducks\\nand chicken and guinea fowls are very well; and he wishes you very much\\nto send him a printed letter, and so does Fanny--and they both rather\\nthink they shall answer it. . . .\\n\\nDr. Gardiner was married yesterday to Mrs. Percy and her three\\ndaughters.\\n\\nNow I will give you the history of Mary\\'s veil, in the purchase of which\\nI have so considerably involved you that it is my duty to economize for\\nyou in the flowers. I had no difficulty in getting a muslin veil for\\nhalf a guinea, and not much more in discovering afterwards that the\\nmuslin was thick, dirty, and ragged, and therefore would by no means do\\nfor a united gift. I changed it consequently as soon as I could, and,\\nconsidering what a state my imprudence had reduced me to, I thought\\nmyself lucky in getting a black lace one for sixteen shillings. I hope\\nthe half of that sum will not greatly exceed what you had intended to\\noffer upon the altar of sister-in-law affection.\\n\\n                                      Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\n\\nThey do not seem to trouble you much from Manydown. I have long wanted\\nto quarrel with them, and I believe I shall take this opportunity. There\\nis no denying that they are very capricious--for they like to enjoy\\ntheir elder sister\\'s company when they can.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[4] The title first chosen for \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I\\nbelieve I drank too much wine last night at Hurstbourne; I know not how\\nelse to account for the shaking of my hand to-day. You will kindly make\\nallowance therefore for any indistinctness of writing, by attributing it\\nto this venial error.\\n\\nNaughty Charles did not come on Tuesday, but good Charles came yesterday\\nmorning. About two o\\'clock he walked in on a Gosport hack. His feeling\\nequal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and his feeling no fatigue in it\\na still better. He walked down to Deane to dinner; he danced the whole\\nevening, and to-day is no more tired than a gentleman ought to be.\\n\\nYour desiring to hear from me on Sunday will, perhaps, bring you a more\\nparticular account of the ball than you may care for, because one is\\nprone to think much more of such things the morning after they happen,\\nthan when time has entirely driven them out of one\\'s recollection.\\n\\nIt was a pleasant evening; Charles found it remarkably so, but I cannot\\ntell why, unless the absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience\\nreproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent, was a relief to\\nhim. There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was\\nmerely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We\\nbegan at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane before five. There were\\nbut fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of\\nthe county, and not many more from the other. My partners were the two\\nSt. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I\\ncalled the last, and whom I liked the best of my little stock.\\n\\nThere were very few beauties, and such as there were were not very\\nhandsome. Miss Iremonger did not look well, and Mrs. Blount was the\\nonly one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,\\nwith the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband,\\nand fat neck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains\\nof the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago;\\nthe other is refined into a nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine\\nBigg. I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I\\nlooked at his daughter, and thought her a queer animal with a white\\nneck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained to think a very fine young woman,\\nwhich I much regret. She danced away with great activity. Her husband is\\nugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so\\n_very_ old. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with\\nbrown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of nose. The General has\\ngot the gout, and Mrs. Maitland the jaundice. Miss Debary, Susan, and\\nSally, all in black, but without any statues, made their appearance, and\\nI was as civil to them as circumstances would allow me. . . .\\n\\nMary said that I looked very well last night. I wore my aunt\\'s gown and\\nhandkerchief, and my hair was at least tidy, which was all my ambition.\\nI will now have done with the ball, and I will moreover go and dress for\\ndinner. . . .\\n\\nFarewell; Charles sends you his best love, and Edward his worst. If you\\nthink the distinction improper, you may take the worst yourself. He\\nwill write to you when he gets back to his ship, and in the mean time\\ndesires that you will consider me as\\n\\n                                    Your affectionate sister,      J. A.\\n\\n_Friday._--I have determined to go on Thursday, but of course not before\\nthe post comes in. Charles is in very good looks indeed. I had the\\ncomfort of finding out the other evening who all the fat girls with long\\nnoses were that disturbed me at the First H. ball. They all proved to be\\nMiss Atkinsons of En--[_illegible_].\\n\\nI rejoice to say that we have just had another letter from our dear\\nFrank. It is to you, very short, written from Larnica in Cyprus, and so\\nlately as October 2. He came from Alexandria, and was to return there in\\nthree or four days, knew nothing of his promotion, and does not write\\nabove twenty lines, from a doubt of the letter\\'s ever reaching you, and\\nan idea of all letters being opened at Vienna. He wrote a few days\\nbefore to you from Alexandria by the \"Mercury,\" sent with despatches to\\nLord Keith. Another letter must be owing to us besides this, one if not\\ntwo; because none of these are to me. Henry comes to-morrow, for one\\nnight only.\\n\\nMy mother has heard from Mrs. E. Leigh. Lady Saye and Seale and her\\ndaughter are going to remove to Bath. Mrs. Estwick is married again to\\na Mr. Sloane, a young man under age, without the knowledge of either\\nfamily.

We\\nmet Mr. Lefroy and Tom Chute, played at cards, and came home again.\\nJames and Mary dined here on the following day, and at night Henry set\\noff in the mail for London. He was as agreeable as ever during his\\nvisit, and has not lost anything in Miss Lloyd's estimation.\\n\\nYesterday we were quite alone--only our four selves; but to-day the\\nscene is agreeably varied by Mary's driving Martha to Basingstoke, and\\nMartha's afterwards dining at Deane.\\n\\nMy mother looks forward with as much certainty as you can do to our\\nkeeping two maids; my father is the only one not in the secret. We plan\\nhaving a steady cook and a young giddy housemaid, with a sedate,\\nmiddle-aged man, who is to undertake the double office of husband to the\\nformer and sweetheart to the latter. No children of course to be allowed\\non either side.\\n\\nYou feel more for John Bond than John Bond deserves. I am sorry to lower\\nhis character, but he is not ashamed to own himself that he has no doubt\\nat all of getting a good place, and that he had even an offer many years\\nago from a Farmer Paine of taking him into his service whenever he might\\nquit my father's.\\n\\nThere are three parts of Bath which we have thought of as likely to have\\nhouses in them,--Westgate Buildings, Charles Street, and some of the\\nshort streets leading from Laura Place or Pulteney Street.\\n\\nWestgate Buildings, though quite in the lower part of the town, are not\\nbadly situated themselves. The street is broad, and has rather a good\\nappearance. Charles Street, however, I think is preferable. The\\nbuildings are new, and its nearness to Kingsmead Fields would be a\\npleasant circumstance. Perhaps you may remember, or perhaps you may\\nforget, that Charles Street leads from the Queen Square Chapel to the\\ntwo Green Park Streets.\\n\\nThe houses in the streets near Laura Place I should expect to be above\\nour price. Gay Street would be too high, except only the lower house on\\nthe left-hand side as you ascend. Towards that my mother has no\\ndisinclination; it used to be lower rented than any other house in the\\nrow, from some inferiority in the apartments. But above all others her\\nwishes are at present fixed on the corner house in Chapel Row, which\\nopens into Prince's Street. Her knowledge of it, however, is confined\\nonly to the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being\\nreally desirable as of its being to be had. In the mean time she assures\\nyou that she will do everything in her power to avoid Trim Street,\\nalthough you have not expressed the fearful presentiment of it which was\\nrather expected.\\n\\nWe know that Mrs. Perrot will want to get us into Oxford Buildings, but\\nwe all unite in particular dislike of that part of the town, and\\ntherefore hope to escape. Upon all these different situations you and\\nEdward may confer together, and your opinion of each will be expected\\nwith eagerness.\\n\\nAs to our pictures, the battle-piece, Mr. Nibbs, Sir William East, and\\nall the old heterogeneous, miscellany, manuscript, Scriptural pieces\\ndispersed over the house, are to be given to James. Your own drawings\\nwill not cease to be your own, and the two paintings on tin will be at\\nyour disposal. My mother says that the French agricultural prints in\\nthe best bedroom were given by Edward to his two sisters. Do you or he\\nknow anything about it?\\n\\nShe has written to my aunt, and we are all impatient for the answer. I\\ndo not know how to give up the idea of our both going to Paragon in May.\\nYour going I consider as indispensably necessary, and I shall not like\\nbeing left behind; there is no place here or hereabouts that I shall\\nwant to be staying at, and though, to be sure, the keep of two will be\\nmore than of one, I will endeavor to make the difference less by\\ndisordering my stomach with Bath buns; and as to the trouble of\\naccommodating us, whether there are one or two, it is much the same.\\n\\nAccording to the first plan, my mother and our two selves are to travel\\ndown together, and my father follow us afterwards in about a fortnight\\nor three weeks. We have promised to spend a couple of days at Ibthorp in\\nour way. We must all meet at Bath, you know, before we set out for the\\nsea, and, everything considered, I think the first plan as good as any.\\n\\nMy father and mother, wisely aware of the difficulty of finding in all\\nBath such a bed as their own, have resolved on taking it with them; all\\nthe beds, indeed, that we shall want are to be removed,--namely, besides\\ntheirs, our own two, the best for a spare one, and two for servants; and\\nthese necessary articles will probably be the only material ones that\\nit would answer to send down. I do not think it will be worth while to\\nremove any of our chests of drawers; we shall be able to get some of a\\nmuch more commodious sort, made of deal, and painted to look very neat;\\nand I flatter myself that for little comforts of all kinds our apartment\\nwill be one of the most complete things of the sort all over Bath,\\nBristol included.\\n\\nWe have thought at times of removing the sideboard, or a Pembroke table,\\nor some other piece of furniture, but, upon the whole, it has ended in\\nthinking that the trouble and risk of the removal would be more than the\\nadvantage of having them at a place where everything may be purchased.\\nPray send your opinion.\\n\\nMartha has as good as promised to come to us again in March. Her spirits\\nare better than they were. . . .\\n\\nMy mother bargains for having no trouble at all in furnishing our house\\nin Bath, and I have engaged for your willingly undertaking to do it all.\\nI get more and more reconciled to the idea of our removal.

I received\\nyours with much general philanthropy, and still more peculiar good-will,\\ntwo days ago; and I suppose I need not tell you that it was very long,\\nbeing written on a foolscap sheet, and very entertaining, being written\\nby you.\\n\\nMr. Payne has been dead long enough for Henry to be out of mourning for\\nhim before his last visit, though we knew nothing of it till about that\\ntime. Why he died, or of what complaint, or to what noblemen he\\nbequeathed his four daughters in marriage, we have not heard.\\n\\nI am glad that the Wildmans are going to give a ball, and hope you will\\nnot fail to benefit both yourself and me by laying out a few kisses in\\nthe purchase of a frank. I believe you are right in proposing to delay\\nthe cambric muslin, and I submit with a kind of voluntary reluctance.\\n\\nMr. Peter Debary has declined Deane curacy; he wishes to be settled near\\nLondon. A foolish reason! as if Deane were not near London in comparison\\nof Exeter or York. Take the whole world through, and he will find many\\nmore places at a greater distance from London than Deane than he will at\\na less. What does he think of Glencoe or Lake Katherine?\\n\\nI feel rather indignant that any possible objection should be raised\\nagainst so valuable a piece of preferment, so delightful a\\nsituation!--that Deane should not be universally allowed to be as near\\nthe metropolis as any other country villages. As this is the case,\\nhowever, as Mr. Peter Debary has shown himself a Peter in the blackest\\nsense of the word, we are obliged to look elsewhere for an heir; and my\\nfather has thought it a necessary compliment to James Digweed to offer\\nthe curacy to him, though without considering it as either a desirable\\nor an eligible situation for him. Unless he is in love with Miss Lyford,\\nI think he had better not be settled exactly in this neighborhood; and\\nunless he is very much in love with her indeed, he is not likely to\\nthink a salary of 50_l._ equal in value or efficiency to one of 75_l._\\n\\nWere you indeed to be considered as one of the fixtures of the\\nhouse!--but you were never actually erected in it either by Mr. Egerton\\nBrydges or Mrs. Lloyd. . . .\\n\\nYou are very kind in planning presents for me to make, and my mother has\\nshown me exactly the same attention; but as I do not choose to have\\ngenerosity dictated to me, I shall not resolve on giving my cabinet to\\nAnna till the first thought of it has been my own.\\n\\nSidmouth is now talked of as our summer abode. Get all the information,\\ntherefore, about it that you can from Mrs. C. Cage.\\n\\nMy father\\'s old ministers are already deserting him to pay their court\\nto his son. The brown mare, which, as well as the black, was to devolve\\non James at our removal, has not had patience to wait for that, and has\\nsettled herself even now at Deane. The death of Hugh Capet, which, like\\nthat of Mr. Skipsey, though undesired, was not wholly unexpected, being\\npurposely effected, has made the immediate possession of the mare very\\nconvenient, and everything else I suppose will be seized by degrees in\\nthe same manner.

You had hoped not to hear from me\\nagain before Tuesday, but Sunday showed you with what a merciless sister\\nyou had to deal. I cannot recall the past, but you shall not hear from\\nme quite so often in future.\\n\\nYour letter to Mary was duly received before she left Deane with Martha\\nyesterday morning, and it gives us great pleasure to know that the\\nChilham ball was so agreeable, and that you danced four dances with Mr.\\nKemble. Desirable, however, as the latter circumstance was, I cannot\\nhelp wondering at its taking place. Why did you dance four dances with\\nso stupid a man? Why not rather dance two of them with some elegant\\nbrother officer who was struck with your appearance as soon as you\\nentered the room?\\n\\nMartha left you her best love. She will write to you herself in a short\\ntime; but trusting to my memory rather than her own, she has\\nnevertheless desired me to ask you to purchase for her two bottles of\\nSteele's lavender water when you are in town, provided you should go to\\nthe shop on your own account, otherwise you may be sure that she would\\nnot have you recollect the request.\\n\\nJames dined with us yesterday, wrote to Edward in the evening, filled\\nthree sides of paper, every line inclining too much towards the\\nnortheast, and the very first line of all scratched out, and this\\nmorning he joins his lady in the fields of Elysium and Ibthorp.\\n\\nLast Friday was a very busy day with us. We were visited by Miss Lyford\\nand Mr. Bayle. The latter began his operations in the house, but had\\nonly time to finish the four sitting-rooms; the rest is deferred till\\nthe spring is more advanced and the days longer. He took his paper of\\nappraisement away with him, and therefore we only know the estimate he\\nhas made of one or two articles of furniture which my father\\nparticularly inquired into. I understand, however, that he was of\\nopinion that the whole would amount to more than two hundred pounds, and\\nit is not imagined that this will comprehend the brewhouse and many\\nother, etc., etc.\\n\\nMiss Lyford was very pleasant, and gave my mother such an account of the\\nhouses in Westgate Buildings, where Mrs. Lyford lodged four years ago,\\nas made her think of a situation there with great pleasure, but your\\nopposition will be without difficulty decisive, and my father, in\\nparticular, who was very well inclined towards the Row before, has now\\nceased to think of it entirely. At present the environs of Laura Place\\nseem to be his choice. His views on the subject are much advanced since\\nI came home; he grows quite ambitious, and actually requires now a\\ncomfortable and a creditable-looking house.\\n\\nOn Saturday Miss Lyford went to her long home,--that is to say, it was a\\nlong way off,--and soon afterwards a party of fine ladies issuing from a\\nwell-known commodious green vehicle, their heads full of Bantam cocks\\nand Galinies, entered the house,--Mrs. Heathcote, Mrs. Harwood, Mrs.\\nJames Austen, Miss Bigg, Miss Jane Blachford.\\n\\nHardly a day passes in which we do not have some visitor or other:\\nyesterday came Mrs. Bramstone, who is very sorry that she is to lose us,\\nand afterwards Mr. Holder, who was shut up for an hour with my father\\nand James in a most awful manner.

Poor fellow! to wait\\nfrom the middle of November to the end of December, and perhaps even\\nlonger, it must be sad work; especially in a place where the ink is so\\nabominably pale. What a surprise to him it must have been on October 20,\\nto be visited, collared, and thrust out of the \"Petterel\" by Captain\\nInglis. He kindly passes over the poignancy of his feelings in quitting\\nhis ship, his officers, and his men.\\n\\nWhat a pity it is that he should not be in England at the time of this\\npromotion, because he certainly would have had an appointment, so\\neverybody says, and therefore it must be right for me to say it too. Had\\nhe been really here, the certainty of the appointment, I dare say, would\\nnot have been half so great, but as it could not be brought to the\\nproof, his absence will be always a lucky source of regret.\\n\\nEliza talks of having read in a newspaper that all the first lieutenants\\nof the frigates whose captains were to be sent into line-of-battle ships\\nwere to be promoted to the rank of commanders.

       " '                               SOUTHAMPTON, Wednesday (January 7, 1807).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--You were mistaken in supposing I should expect your\\nletter on Sunday; I had no idea of hearing from you before Tuesday, and\\nmy pleasure yesterday was therefore unhurt by any previous\\ndisappointment. I thank you for writing so much; you must really have\\nsent me the value of two letters in one. We are extremely glad to hear\\nthat Elizabeth is so much better, and hope you will be sensible of still\\nfurther amendment in her when you return from Canterbury.\\n\\nOf your visit there I must now speak \"incessantly;\" it surprises, but\\npleases me more, and I consider it as a very just and honorable\\ndistinction of you, and not less to the credit of Mrs. Knight. I have no\\ndoubt of your spending your time with her most pleasantly in quiet and\\nrational conversation, and am so far from thinking her expectations of\\nyou will be deceived, that my only fear is of your being so agreeable,\\nso much to her taste, as to make her wish to keep you with her forever.\\nIf that should be the case, we must remove to Canterbury, which I should\\nnot like so well as Southampton.\\n\\nWhen you receive this, our guests will be all gone or going; and I shall\\nbe left to the comfortable disposal of my time, to ease of mind from the\\ntorments of rice puddings and apple dumplings, and probably to regret\\nthat I did not take more pains to please them all.\\n\\nMrs. J. Austen has asked me to return with her to Steventon; I need not\\ngive my answer; and she has invited my mother to spend there the time of\\nMrs. F. A.\\'s confinement, which she seems half inclined to do.\\n\\nA few days ago I had a letter from Miss Irvine, and as I was in her\\ndebt, you will guess it to be a remonstrance, not a very severe one,\\nhowever; the first page is in her usual retrospective, jealous,\\ninconsistent style, but the remainder is chatty and harmless. She\\nsupposes my silence may have proceeded from resentment of her not having\\nwritten to inquire particularly after my hooping-cough, etc. She is a\\nfunny one.\\n\\nI have answered her letter, and have endeavored to give something like\\nthe truth with as little incivility as I could, by placing my silence to\\nthe want of subject in the very quiet way in which we live. Phebe has\\nrepented, and stays. I have also written to Charles, and I answered Miss\\nBuller\\'s letter by return of post, as I intended to tell you in my last.\\n\\nTwo or three things I recollected when it was too late, that I might\\nhave told you; one is that the Welbys have lost their eldest son by a\\nputrid fever at Eton, and another that Tom Chute is going to settle in\\nNorfolk.\\n\\nYou have scarcely ever mentioned Lizzy since your being at Godmersham. I\\nhope it is not because she is altered for the worse.\\n\\nI cannot yet satisfy Fanny as to Mrs. Foote\\'s baby\\'s name, and I must\\nnot encourage her to expect a good one, as Captain Foote is a professed\\nadversary to all but the plainest; he likes only Mary, Elizabeth, Anne,\\netc. Our best chance is of \"Caroline,\" which in compliment to a sister\\nseems the only exception.\\n\\nHe dined with us on Friday, and I fear will not soon venture again, for\\nthe strength of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton, underdone even\\nfor James; and Captain Foote has a particular dislike to underdone\\nmutton; but he was so good-humored and pleasant that I did not much mind\\nhis being starved. He gives us all the most cordial invitation to his\\nhouse in the country, saying just what the Williams ought to say to make\\nus welcome. Of them we have seen nothing since you left us, and we hear\\nthat they are just gone to Bath again, to be out of the way of further\\nalterations at Brooklands.\\n\\nMrs. F. A. has had a very agreeable letter from Mrs. Dickson, who was\\ndelighted with the purse, and desires her not to provide herself with a\\nchristening dress, which is exactly what her young correspondent wanted;\\nand she means to defer making any of the caps as long as she can, in\\nhope of having Mrs. D.\\'s present in time to be serviceable as a pattern.\\nShe desires me to tell you that the gowns were cut out before your\\nletter arrived, but that they are long enough for Caroline. The _Beds_,\\nas I believe they are called, have fallen to Frank\\'s share to continue,\\nand of course are cut out to admiration.\\n\\n\"Alphonsine\" did not do. We were disgusted in twenty pages, as,\\nindependent of a bad translation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a\\npen hitherto so pure; and we changed it for the \"Female Quixote,\" which\\nnow makes our evening amusement; to me a very high one, as I find the\\nwork quite equal to what I remembered it. Mrs. F. A., to whom it is new,\\nenjoys it as one could wish; the other Mary, I believe, has little\\npleasure from that or any other book.\\n\\nMy mother does not seem at all more disappointed than ourselves at the\\ntermination of the family treaty; she thinks less of that just now than\\nof the comfortable state of her own finances, which she finds on closing\\nher year\\'s accounts beyond her expectation, as she begins the new year\\nwith a balance of 30_l._ in her favor; and when she has written her\\nanswer to my aunt, which you know always hangs a little upon her mind,\\nshe will be above the world entirely. You will have a great deal of\\nunreserved discourse with Mrs. K., I dare say, upon this subject, as\\nwell as upon many other of our family matters. Abuse everybody but me.\\n\\n_Thursday._--We expected James yesterday, but he did not come; if he\\ncomes at all now, his visit will be a very short one, as he must return\\nto-morrow, that Ajax and the chair may be sent to Winchester on\\nSaturday. Caroline\\'s new pelisse depended upon her mother\\'s being able\\nor not to come so far in the chair; how the guinea that will be saved by\\nthe same means of return is to be spent I know not. Mrs. J. A. does not\\ntalk much of poverty now, though she has no hope of my brother\\'s being\\nable to buy another horse next summer.\\n\\nTheir scheme against Warwickshire continues, but I doubt the family\\'s\\nbeing at Stoneleigh so early as James says he must go, which is May.\\n\\nMy mother is afraid I have not been explicit enough on the subject of\\nher wealth; she began 1806 with 68_l._ she begins 1807 with 99_l._, and\\nthis after 32_l._ purchase of stock. Frank too has been settling his\\naccounts and making calculations, and each party feels quite equal to\\nour present expenses; but much increase of house-rent would not do for\\neither. Frank limits himself, I believe, to four hundred a year.\\n\\nYou will be surprised to hear that Jenny is not yet come back; we have\\nheard nothing of her since her reaching Itchingswell, and can only\\nsuppose that she must be detained by illness in somebody or other, and\\nthat she has been each day expecting to be able to come on the morrow. I\\nam glad I did not know beforehand that she was to be absent during the\\nwhole or almost the whole of our friends being with us, for though the\\ninconvenience has not been nothing, I should have feared still more.\\nOur dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only Molly\\'s\\nhead and Molly\\'s hands to conduct them; she fries better than she did,\\nbut not like Jenny.\\n\\nWe did _not_ take our walk on Friday, it was too dirty, nor have we yet\\ndone it; we may perhaps do something like it to-day, as after seeing\\nFrank skate, which he hopes to do in the meadows by the beech, we are to\\ntreat ourselves with a passage over the ferry. It is one of the\\npleasantest frosts I ever knew, so very quiet. I hope it will last some\\ntime longer for Frank\\'s sake, who is quite anxious to get some skating;\\nhe tried yesterday, but it would not do.\\n\\nOur acquaintance increase too fast. He was recognized lately by Admiral\\nBertie, and a few days since arrived the Admiral and his daughter\\nCatherine to wait upon us. There was nothing to like or dislike in\\neither. To the Berties are to be added the Lances, with whose cards we\\nhave been endowed, and whose visit Frank and I returned yesterday. They\\nlive about a mile and three-quarters from S. to the right of the new\\nroad to Portsmouth, and I believe their house is one of those which are\\nto be seen almost anywhere among the woods on the other side of the\\nItchen. It is a handsome building, stands high, and in a very beautiful\\nsituation.\\n\\nWe found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether she boasts any offspring\\nbesides a grand pianoforte did not appear. She was civil and chatty\\nenough, and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance in Southampton,\\nwhich we gratefully declined.\\n\\nI suppose they must be acting by the orders of Mr. Lance of Netherton in\\nthis civility, as there seems no other reason for their coming near us.\\nThey will not come often, I dare say. They live in a handsome style and\\nare rich, and she seemed to like to be rich, and we gave her to\\nunderstand that we were far from being so; she will soon feel therefore\\nthat we are not worth her acquaintance.\\n\\nYou must have heard from Martha by this time. We have had no accounts of\\nKintbury since her letter to me.\\n\\nMrs. F. A. has had one fainting fit lately; it came on as usual after\\neating a hearty dinner, but did not last long.\\n\\nI can recollect nothing more to say. When my letter is gone, I suppose I\\nshall.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      J. A.\\n\\nI have just asked Caroline if I should send her love to her godmamma, to\\nwhich she answered \"Yes.\"\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

OUR garden is putting in order by a man who bears a remarkably\\ngood character, has a very fine complexion, and asks something less than\\nthe first. The shrubs which border the gravel walk, he says, are only\\nsweetbrier and roses, and the latter of an indifferent sort; we mean to\\nget a few of a better kind, therefore, and at my own particular desire\\nhe procures us some syringas. I could not do without a syringa, for the\\nsake of Cowper\\'s line. We talk also of a laburnum. The border under the\\nterrace wall is clearing away to receive currants and gooseberry bushes,\\nand a spot is found very proper for raspberries.\\n\\nThe alterations and improvements within doors, too, advance very\\nproperly, and the offices will be made very convenient indeed. Our\\ndressing-table is constructing on the spot, out of a large kitchen table\\nbelonging to the house, for doing which we have the permission of Mr.\\nHusket, Lord Lansdown\\'s painter,--domestic painter, I should call him,\\nfor he lives in the castle. Domestic chaplains have given way to this\\nmore necessary office, and I suppose whenever the walls want no touching\\nup he is employed about my lady\\'s face.\\n\\nThe morning was so wet that I was afraid we should not be able to see\\nour little visitor; but Frank, who alone could go to church, called for\\nher after service, and she is now talking away at my side and examining\\nthe treasures of my writing-desk drawers,--very happy, I believe. Not at\\nall shy, of course. Her name is Catherine, and her sister\\'s Caroline.\\nShe is something like her brother, and as short for her age, but not so\\nwell-looking.\\n\\nWhat is become of all the shyness in the world? Moral as well as natural\\ndiseases disappear in the progress of time, and new ones take their\\nplace. Shyness and the sweating sickness have given way to confidence\\nand paralytic complaints. . . .\\n\\n_Evening._--Our little visitor has just left us, and left us highly\\npleased with her; she is a nice, natural, open-hearted, affectionate\\ngirl, with all the ready civility which one sees in the best children in\\nthe present day; so unlike anything that I was myself at her age, that I\\nam often all astonishment and shame. Half her time was spent at\\nspillikins, which I consider as a very valuable part of our household\\nfurniture, and as not the least important benefaction from the family of\\nKnight to that of Austen.\\n\\nBut I must tell you a story. Mary has for some time had notice from Mrs.\\nDickson of the intended arrival of a certain Miss Fowler in this place.\\nMiss F. is an intimate friend of Mrs. D., and a good deal known as such\\nto Mary. On Thursday last she called here while we were out. Mary\\nfound, on our return, her card with only her name on it, and she had\\nleft word that she would call again. The particularity of this made us\\ntalk, and, among other conjectures, Frank said in joke, \"I dare say she\\nis staying with the Pearsons.\" The connection of the names struck Mary,\\nand she immediately recollected Miss Fowler\\'s having been very intimate\\nwith persons so called, and, upon putting everything together, we have\\nscarcely a doubt of her being actually staying with the only family in\\nthe place whom we cannot visit.\\n\\nWhat a _contretemps_! in the language of France. What an unluckiness! in\\nthat of Madame Duval. The black gentleman has certainly employed one of\\nhis menial imps to bring about this complete, though trifling mischief.\\nMiss F. has never called again, but we are in daily expectation of it.\\nMiss P. has, of course, given her a proper understanding of the\\nbusiness. It is evident that Miss F. did not expect or wish to have the\\nvisit returned, and Frank is quite as much on his guard for his wife as\\nwe could desire for her sake or our own.\\n\\nWe shall rejoice in being so near Winchester when Edward belongs to it,\\nand can never have our spare bed filled more to our satisfaction than by\\nhim. Does he leave Eltham at Easter?\\n\\nWe are reading \"Clarentine,\" and are surprised to find how foolish it\\nis. I remember liking it much less on a second reading than at the\\nfirst, and it does not bear a third at all. It is full of unnatural\\nconduct and forced difficulties, without striking merit of any kind.\\n\\nMiss Harrison is going into Devonshire, to attend Mrs. Dusantoy, as\\nusual. Miss J. is married to young Mr. G., and is to be very unhappy. He\\nswears, drinks, is cross, jealous, selfish, and brutal. The match makes\\nher family miserable, and has occasioned his being disinherited.\\n\\nThe Browns are added to our list of acquaintance. He commands the Sea\\nFencibles here, under Sir Thomas, and was introduced at his own desire\\nby the latter when we saw him last week. As yet the gentlemen only have\\nvisited, as Mrs. B. is ill; but she is a nice-looking woman, and wears\\none of the prettiest straw bonnets in the place.\\n\\n_Monday._--The garret beds are made, and ours will be finished to-day. I\\nhad hoped it would be finished on Saturday, but neither Mrs. Hall nor\\nJenny was able to give help enough for that, and I have as yet done very\\nlittle, and Mary nothing at all. This week we shall do more, and I\\nshould like to have all the five beds completed by the end of it. There\\nwill then be the window-curtains, sofa-cover, and a carpet to be\\naltered.\\n\\nI should not be surprised if we were to be visited by James again this\\nweek; he gave us reason to expect him soon, and if they go to Eversley\\nhe cannot come next week.\\n\\nThere, I flatter myself I have constructed you a smartish letter,\\nconsidering my want of materials; but, like my dear Dr. Johnson, I\\nbelieve I have dealt more in notions than facts.\\n\\nI hope your cough is gone, and that you are otherwise well, and remain,\\nwith love,\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      J.

       " \"                             GODMERSHAM, Wednesday (June 15, 1808).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Where shall I begin? Which of all my important\\nnothings shall I tell you first? At half after seven yesterday morning\\nHenry saw us into our own carriage, and we drove away from the Bath\\nHotel; which, by the by, had been found most uncomfortable\\nquarters,--very dirty, very noisy, and very ill-provided. James began\\nhis journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles were hot;\\nDeptford Hill brought to my mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen\\nyears ago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the day\\nadvanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford, which we reached within the\\ntwo hours and three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same inn at\\nwhich we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the present occasion\\nhad about the same bad butter.\\n\\nAt half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling on without any\\nadventure reached Sittingbourne by three. Daniel was watching for us at\\nthe door of the George, and I was acknowledged very kindly by Mr. and\\nMrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted my conversation, while\\nMary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for\\nSittingbourne; and so off we drove, drove, drove, and by six o'clock\\nwere at Godmersham.\\n\\nOur two brothers were walking before the house as we approached, as\\nnatural as life. Fanny and Lizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of\\npleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the breakfast-parlor, and\\nthen proceeded to our rooms. Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the\\nYellow room--very literally--for I am writing in it at this moment. It\\nseems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself, and to be at\\nGodmersham without you is also odd.\\n\\nYou are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who came to me as soon as she\\nhad seen her Aunt James to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as\\nenergetic as usual in her longings for you. She is grown both in height\\nand size since last year, but not immoderately, looks very well, and\\nseems as to conduct and manner just what she was and what one could wish\\nher to continue.\\n\\nElizabeth,[5] who was dressing when we arrived, came to me for a minute\\nattended by Marianne, Charles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave\\nme a very affectionate welcome. That I had received such from Edward\\nalso I need not mention; but I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I\\nnever saw him look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly\\nwell. I cannot praise Elizabeth's looks, but they are probably affected\\nby a cold. Her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three\\nyears, though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is not quite so\\nlovely as he was. Louisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find\\nhandsomer than I expected, though at present disguised by such a violent\\nbreaking-out that she does not come down after dinner. She has charming\\neyes and a nice open countenance, and seems likely to be very lovable.\\nHer size is magnificent.\\n\\nI was agreeably surprised to find Louisa Bridges still here. She looks\\nremarkably well (legacies are very wholesome diet), and is just what she\\nalways was. John is at Sandling. You may fancy our dinner-party\\ntherefore; Fanny, of course, belonging to it, and little Edward, for\\nthat day. He was almost too happy, his happiness at least made him too\\ntalkative.\\n\\nIt has struck ten; I must go to breakfast.\\n\\nSince breakfast I have had a _tête-à-tête_ with Edward in his room; he\\nwanted to know James's plans and mine, and from what his own now are I\\nthink it already nearly certain that I shall return when they do, though\\nnot with them. Edward will be going about the same time to Alton, where\\nhe has business with Mr. Trimmer, and where he means his son should join\\nhim; and I shall probably be his companion to that place, and get on\\nafterwards somehow or other.\\n\\nI should have preferred a rather longer stay here certainly, but there\\nis no prospect of any later conveyance for me, as he does not mean to\\naccompany Edward on his return to Winchester, from a very natural\\nunwillingness to leave Elizabeth at that time. I shall at any rate be\\nglad not to be obliged to be an incumbrance on those who have brought me\\nhere, for, as James has no horse, I must feel in their carriage that I\\nam taking his place. We were rather crowded yesterday, though it does\\nnot become me to say so, as I and my boa were of the party, and it is\\nnot to be supposed but that a child of three years of age was fidgety.\\n\\nI need scarcely beg you to keep all this to yourself, lest it should get\\nround by Anna's means. She is very kindly inquired after by her friends\\nhere, who all regret her not coming with her father and mother.\\n\\nI left Henry, I hope, free from his tiresome complaint, in other\\nrespects well, and thinking with great pleasure of Cheltenham and\\nStoneleigh.\\n\\nThe brewery scheme is quite at an end: at a meeting of the subscribers\\nlast week it was by general, and I believe very hearty, consent\\ndissolved.\\n\\nThe country is very beautiful.

It came in a short letter to Martha\\nfrom her sister, begun at Steventon and finished in Winchester.\\n\\nWe have felt, we do feel, for you all, as you will not need to be\\ntold,--for you, for Fanny, for Henry, for Lady Bridges, and for dearest\\nEdward, whose loss and whose sufferings seem to make those of every\\nother person nothing. God be praised that you can say what you do of\\nhim: that he has a religious mind to bear him up, and a disposition that\\nwill gradually lead him to comfort.\\n\\nMy dear, dear Fanny, I am so thankful that she has you with her! You\\nwill be everything to her; you will give her all the consolation that\\nhuman aid can give. May the Almighty sustain you all, and keep you, my\\ndearest Cassandra, well; but for the present I dare say you are equal to\\neverything.\\n\\nYou will know that the poor boys are at Steventon. Perhaps it is best\\nfor them, as they will have more means of exercise and amusement there\\nthan they could have with us, but I own myself disappointed by the\\narrangement. I should have loved to have them with me at such a time. I\\nshall write to Edward by this post.\\n\\nWe shall, of course, hear from you again very soon, and as often as you\\ncan write. We will write as you desire, and I shall add Bookham.\\nHamstall, I suppose, you write to yourselves, as you do not mention it.\\n\\nWhat a comfort that Mrs. Deedes is saved from present misery and alarm!\\nBut it will fall heavy upon poor Harriot; and as for Lady B., but that\\nher fortitude does seem truly great, I should fear the effect of such a\\nblow, and so unlooked for. I long to hear more of you all. Of Henry's\\nanguish I think with grief and solicitude; but he will exert himself to\\nbe of use and comfort.\\n\\nWith what true sympathy our feelings are shared by Martha you need not\\nbe told; she is the friend and sister under every circumstance.\\n\\nWe need not enter into a panegyric on the departed, but it is sweet to\\nthink of her great worth, of her solid principles, of her true devotion,\\nher excellence in every relation of life. It is also consolatory to\\nreflect on the shortness of the sufferings which led her from this world\\nto a better.\\n\\nFarewell for the present, my dearest sister. Tell Edward that we feel\\nfor him and pray for him.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\n                                                      J.

Edward's loss is terrible, and must be felt\\nas such, and these are too early days indeed to think of moderation in\\ngrief, either in him or his afflicted daughter, but soon we may hope\\nthat our dear Fanny's sense of duty to that beloved father will rouse\\nher to exertion. For his sake, and as the most acceptable proof of love\\nto the spirit of her departed mother, she will try to be tranquil and\\nresigned. Does she feel you to be a comfort to her, or is she too much\\noverpowered for anything but solitude?\\n\\nYour account of Lizzy is very interesting. Poor child! One must hope the\\nimpression will be strong, and yet one's heart aches for a dejected mind\\nof eight years old.\\n\\nI suppose you see the corpse? How does it appear? We are anxious to be\\nassured that Edward will not attend the funeral, but when it comes to\\nthe point I think he must feel it impossible.\\n\\nYour parcel shall set off on Monday, and I hope the shoes will fit;\\nMartha and I both tried them on. I shall send you such of your mourning\\nas I think most likely to be useful, reserving for myself your stockings\\nand half the velvet, in which selfish arrangement I know I am doing what\\nyou wish.\\n\\nI am to be in bombazeen and crape, according to what we are told is\\nuniversal here, and which agrees with Martha's previous observation. My\\nmourning, however, will not impoverish me, for by having my velvet\\npelisse fresh lined and made up, I am sure I shall have no occasion this\\nwinter for anything new of that sort. I take my cloak for the lining,\\nand shall send yours on the chance of its doing something of the same\\nfor you, though I believe your pelisse is in better repair than mine.\\nOne Miss Baker makes my gown and the other my bonnet, which is to be\\nsilk covered with crape.\\n\\nI have written to Edward Cooper, and hope he will not send one of his\\nletters of cruel comfort to my poor brother: and yesterday I wrote to\\nAlethea Bigg, in reply to a letter from her. She tells us in confidence\\nthat Catherine is to be married on Tuesday se'nnight. Mr. Hill is\\nexpected at Manydown in the course of the ensuing week.\\n\\nWe are desired by Mrs. Harrison and Miss Austen to say everything proper\\nfor them to yourself and Edward on this sad occasion, especially that\\nnothing but a wish of not giving additional trouble where so much is\\ninevitable prevents their writing themselves to express their concern.\\nThey seem truly to feel concern.\\n\\nI am glad you can say what you do of Mrs. Knight and of Goodnestone in\\ngeneral. It is a great relief to me to know that the shock did not make\\nany of them ill. But what a task was yours to announce it! Now I hope\\nyou are not overpowered with letter-writing, as Henry and John can ease\\nyou of many of your correspondents.\\n\\nWas Mr. Scudamore in the house at the time, was any application\\nattempted, and is the seizure at all accounted for?\\n\\n_Sunday._--As Edward's letter to his son is not come here, we know that\\nyou must have been informed as early as Friday of the boys being at\\nSteventon, which I am glad of.\\n\\nUpon your letter to Dr. Goddard's being forwarded to them, Mary wrote to\\nask whether my mother wished to have her grandsons sent to her. We\\ndecided on their remaining where they were, which I hope my brother will\\napprove of. I am sure he will do us the justice of believing that in\\nsuch a decision we sacrificed inclination to what we thought best.\\n\\nI shall write by the coach to-morrow to Mrs. J. A., and to Edward, about\\ntheir mourning, though this day's post will probably bring directions to\\nthem on that subject from yourselves. I shall certainly make use of the\\nopportunity of addressing our nephew on the most serious of all\\nconcerns, as I naturally did in my letter to him before. The poor boys\\nare, perhaps, more comfortable at Steventon than they could be here, but\\nyou will understand my feelings with respect to it.\\n\\nTo-morrow will be a dreadful day for you all. Mr. Whitfield's will be a\\nsevere duty.[7] Glad shall I be to hear that it is over.\\n\\nThat you are forever in our thoughts you will not doubt. I see your\\nmournful party in my mind's eye under every varying circumstance of the\\nday; and in the evening especially figure to myself its sad gloom: the\\nefforts to talk, the frequent summons to melancholy orders and cares,\\nand poor Edward, restless in misery, going from one room to another, and\\nperhaps not seldom upstairs, to see all that remains of his Elizabeth.\\nDearest Fanny must now look upon herself as his prime source of comfort,\\nhis dearest friend; as the being who is gradually to supply to him, to\\nthe extent that is possible, what he has lost. This consideration will\\nelevate and cheer her.\\n\\nAdieu. You cannot write too often, as I said before. We are heartily\\nrejoiced that the poor baby gives you no particular anxiety.

       " '                                    CASTLE SQUARE, Monday (October 24).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Edward and George came to us soon after seven on\\nSaturday, very well, but very cold, having by choice travelled on the\\noutside, and with no greatcoat but what Mr. Wise, the coachman,\\ngood-naturedly spared them of his, as they sat by his side. They were so\\nmuch chilled when they arrived, that I was afraid they must have taken\\ncold; but it does not seem at all the case: I never saw them looking\\nbetter.\\n\\nThey behave extremely well in every respect, showing quite as much\\nfeeling as one wishes to see, and on every occasion speaking of their\\nfather with the liveliest affection. His letter was read over by each of\\nthem yesterday, and with many tears; George sobbed aloud, Edward\\'s tears\\ndo not flow so easily; but as far as I can judge they are both very\\nproperly impressed by what has happened. Miss Lloyd, who is a more\\nimpartial judge than I can be, is exceedingly pleased with them.\\n\\nGeorge is almost a new acquaintance to me, and I find him in a different\\nway as engaging as Edward.\\n\\nWe do not want amusement: bilbocatch, at which George is indefatigable,\\nspillikins, paper ships, riddles, conundrums, and cards, with watching\\nthe flow and ebb of the river, and now and then a stroll out, keep us\\nwell employed; and we mean to avail ourselves of our kind papa\\'s\\nconsideration, by not returning to Winchester till quite the evening of\\nWednesday.\\n\\nMrs. J. A. had not time to get them more than one suit of clothes; their\\nothers are making here, and though I do not believe Southampton is\\nfamous for tailoring, I hope it will prove itself better than\\nBasingstoke. Edward has an old black coat, which will save his having a\\nsecond new one; but I find that black pantaloons are considered by them\\nas necessary, and of course one would not have them made uncomfortable\\nby the want of what is usual on such occasions.\\n\\nFanny\\'s letter was received with great pleasure yesterday, and her\\nbrother sends his thanks and will answer it soon. We all saw what she\\nwrote, and were very much pleased with it.\\n\\nTo-morrow I hope to hear from you, and to-morrow we must think of poor\\nCatherine. To-day Lady Bridges is the heroine of our thoughts, and glad\\nshall we be when we can fancy the meeting over. There will then be\\nnothing so very bad for Edward to undergo.\\n\\nThe \"St. Albans,\" I find, sailed on the very day of my letters reaching\\nYarmouth, so that we must not expect an answer at present; we scarcely\\nfeel, however, to be in suspense, or only enough to keep our plans to\\nourselves. We have been obliged to explain them to our young visitors,\\nin consequence of Fanny\\'s letter, but we have not yet mentioned them to\\nSteventon. We are all quite familiarized to the idea ourselves; my\\nmother only wants Mrs. Seward to go out at midsummer.\\n\\nWhat sort of a kitchen garden is there? Mrs. J. A. expresses her fear of\\nour settling in Kent, and, till this proposal was made, we began to look\\nforward to it here; my mother was actually talking of a house at Wye. It\\nwill be best, however, as it is.\\n\\nAnne has just given her mistress warning; she is going to be married; I\\nwish she would stay her year.\\n\\nOn the subject of matrimony, I must notice a wedding in the Salisbury\\npaper, which has amused me very much, Dr. Phillot to Lady Frances St.\\nLawrence. She wanted to have a husband, I suppose, once in her life, and\\nhe a Lady Frances.\\n\\nI hope your sorrowing party were at church yesterday, and have no longer\\nthat to dread. Martha was kept at home by a cold, but I went with my two\\nnephews, and I saw Edward was much affected by the sermon, which,\\nindeed, I could have supposed purposely addressed to the afflicted, if\\nthe text had not naturally come in the course of Dr. Mant\\'s observations\\non the Litany: \\'All that are in danger, necessity, or tribulation,\\' was\\nthe subject of it. The weather did not allow us afterwards to get\\nfarther than the quay, where George was very happy as long as we could\\nstay, flying about from one side to the other, and skipping on board a\\ncollier immediately.\\n\\nIn the evening we had the Psalms and Lessons, and a sermon at home, to\\nwhich they were very attentive; but you will not expect to hear that\\nthey did not return to conundrums the moment it was over. Their aunt has\\nwritten pleasantly of them, which was more than I hoped.\\n\\nWhile I write now, George is most industriously making and naming paper\\nships, at which he afterwards shoots with horse-chestnuts, brought from\\nSteventon on purpose; and Edward equally intent over the \"Lake of\\nKillarney,\" twisting himself about in one of our great chairs.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--Your close-written letter makes me quite ashamed of my wide\\nlines; you have sent me a great deal of matter, most of it very welcome.\\nAs to your lengthened stay, it is no more than I expected, and what must\\nbe, but you cannot suppose I like it.\\n\\nAll that you say of Edward is truly comfortable; I began to fear that\\nwhen the bustle of the first week was over, his spirits might for a time\\nbe more depressed; and perhaps one must still expect something of the\\nkind. If you escape a bilious attack, I shall wonder almost as much as\\nrejoice. I am glad you mentioned where Catherine goes to-day; it is a\\ngood plan, but sensible people may generally be trusted to form such.\\n\\nThe day began cheerfully, but it is not likely to continue what it\\nshould, for them or for us. We had a little water-party yesterday; I and\\nmy two nephews went from the Itchen Ferry up to Northam, where we\\nlanded, looked into the 74, and walked home, and it was so much enjoyed\\nthat I had intended to take them to Netley to-day; the tide is just\\nright for our going immediately after moonshine, but I am afraid there\\nwill be rain; if we cannot get so far, however, we may perhaps go round\\nfrom the ferry to the quay.\\n\\nI had not proposed doing more than cross the Itchen yesterday, but it\\nproved so pleasant, and so much to the satisfaction of all, that when we\\nreached the middle of the stream we agreed to be rowed up the river;\\nboth the boys rowed great part of the way, and their questions and\\nremarks, as well as their enjoyment, were very amusing; George\\'s\\ninquiries were endless, and his eagerness in everything reminds me often\\nof his uncle Henry.\\n\\nOur evening was equally agreeable in its way: I introduced speculation,\\nand it was so much approved that we hardly knew how to leave off.\\n\\nYour idea of an early dinner to-morrow is exactly what we propose, for,\\nafter writing the first part of this letter, it came into my head that\\nat this time of year we have not summer evenings. We shall watch the\\nlight to-day, that we may not give them a dark drive to-morrow.\\n\\nThey send their best love to papa and everybody, with George\\'s thanks\\nfor the letter brought by this post. Martha begs my brother may be\\nassured of her interest in everything relating to him and his family,\\nand of her sincerely partaking our pleasure in the receipt of every good\\naccount from Godmersham.\\n\\nOf Chawton I think I can have nothing more to say, but that everything\\nyou say about it in the letter now before me will, I am sure, as soon as\\nI am able to read it to her, make my mother consider the plan with more\\nand more pleasure. We had formed the same views on H. Digweed\\'s farm.\\n\\nA very kind and feeling letter is arrived to-day from Kintbury. Mrs.\\nFowle\\'s sympathy and solicitude on such an occasion you will be able to\\ndo justice to, and to express it as she wishes to my brother. Concerning\\nyou, she says: \"Cassandra will, I know, excuse my writing to her; it is\\nnot to save myself but her that I omit so doing. Give my best, my\\nkindest love to her, and tell her I feel for her as I know she would for\\nme on the same occasion, and that I most sincerely hope her health will\\nnot suffer.\"\\n\\nWe have just had two hampers of apples from Kintbury, and the floor of\\nour little garret is almost covered.

       " \"                                    CASTLE SQUARE, Sunday (November 21).\\n\\nYOUR letter, my dear Cassandra, obliges me to write immediately, that\\nyou may have the earliest notice of Frank's intending, if possible, to\\ngo to Godmersham exactly at the time now fixed for your visit to\\nGoodnestone.\\n\\nHe resolved, almost directly on the receipt of your former letter, to\\ntry for an extension of his leave of absence, that he might be able to\\ngo down to you for two days, but charged me not to give you any notice\\nof it, on account of the uncertainty of success. Now, however, I must\\ngive it, and now perhaps he may be giving it himself; for I am just in\\nthe hateful predicament of being obliged to write what I know will\\nsomehow or other be of no use.\\n\\nHe meant to ask for five days more, and if they were granted, to go down\\nby Thursday night's mail, and spend Friday and Saturday with you; and he\\nconsidered his chance of succeeding by no means bad. I hope it will take\\nplace as he planned, and that your arrangements with Goodnestone may\\nadmit of suitable alteration.\\n\\nYour news of Edward Bridges was quite news, for I have had no letter\\nfrom Wrotham. I wish him happy with all my heart, and hope his choice\\nmay turn out according to his own expectations, and beyond those of his\\nfamily; and I dare say it will. Marriage is a great improver, and in a\\nsimilar situation Harriet may be as amiable as Eleanor. As to money,\\nthat will come, you may be sure, because they cannot do without it. When\\nyou see him again, pray give him our congratulations and best wishes.\\nThis match will certainly set John and Lucy going.\\n\\nThere are six bedchambers at Chawton; Henry wrote to my mother the other\\nday, and luckily mentioned the number, which is just what we wanted to\\nbe assured of. He speaks also of garrets for store-places, one of which\\nshe immediately planned fitting up for Edward's man-servant; and now\\nperhaps it must be for our own; for she is already quite reconciled to\\nour keeping one. The difficulty of doing without one had been thought of\\nbefore. His name shall be Robert, if you please.\\n\\nBefore I can tell you of it, you will have heard that Miss Sawbridge is\\nmarried. It took place, I believe, on Thursday. Mrs. Fowle has for some\\ntime been in the secret, but the neighborhood in general were quite\\nunsuspicious. Mr. Maxwell was tutor to the young Gregorys,--consequently,\\nthey must be one of the happiest couples in the world, and either of\\nthem worthy of envy, for she must be excessively in love, and he mounts\\nfrom nothing to a comfortable home. Martha has heard him very highly\\nspoken of. They continue for the present at Speen Hill.\\n\\nI have a Southampton match to return for your Kentish one, Captain G.\\nHeathcote and Miss A. Lyell. I have it from Alethea, and like it,\\nbecause I had made it before.\\n\\nYes, the Stoneleigh business is concluded, but it was not till yesterday\\nthat my mother was regularly informed of it, though the news had reached\\nus on Monday evening by way of Steventon. My aunt says as little as may\\nbe on the subject by way of information, and nothing at all by way of\\nsatisfaction. She reflects on Mr. T. Leigh's dilatoriness, and looks\\nabout with great diligence and success for inconvenience and evil, among\\nwhich she ingeniously places the danger of her new housemaids catching\\ncold on the outside of the coach, when she goes down to Bath, for a\\ncarriage makes her sick.\\n\\nJohn Binns has been offered their place, but declines it; as she\\nsupposes, because he will not wear a livery. Whatever be the cause, I\\nlike the effect.\\n\\nIn spite of all my mother's long and intimate knowledge of the writer,\\nshe was not up to the expectation of such a letter as this; the\\ndiscontentedness of it shocked and surprised her--but I see nothing in\\nit out of nature, though a sad nature.\\n\\nShe does not forget to wish for Chambers, you may be sure. No\\nparticulars are given, not a word of arrears mentioned, though in her\\nletter to James they were in a general way spoken of. The amount of them\\nis a matter of conjecture, and to my mother a most interesting one; she\\ncannot fix any time for their beginning with any satisfaction to herself\\nbut Mrs. Leigh's death, and Henry's two thousand pounds neither agrees\\nwith that period nor any other. I did not like to own our previous\\ninformation of what was intended last July, and have therefore only said\\nthat if we could see Henry we might hear many particulars, as I had\\nunderstood that some confidential conversation had passed between him\\nand Mr. T. L. at Stoneleigh.\\n\\nWe have been as quiet as usual since Frank and Mary left us; Mr.\\nCriswick called on Martha that very morning on his way home again from\\nPortsmouth, and we have had no visitor since.\\n\\nWe called on the Miss Lyells one day, and heard a good account of Mr.\\nHeathcote's canvass, the success of which, of course, exceeds his\\nexpectations. Alethea in her letter hopes for my interest, which I\\nconclude means Edward's, and I take this opportunity, therefore, of\\nrequesting that he will bring in Mr. Heathcote. Mr. Lane told us\\nyesterday that Mr. H. had behaved very handsomely, and waited on Mr.\\nThistlethwaite, to say that if he (Mr. T.) would stand, he (Mr. H.)\\nwould not oppose him; but Mr. T. declined it, acknowledging himself\\nstill smarting under the payment of late electioneering costs.\\n\\nThe Mrs. Hulberts, we learn from Kintbury, come to Steventon this week,\\nand bring Mary Jane Fowle with them on her way to Mrs. Nune's; she\\nreturns at Christmas with her brother.\\n\\nOur brother we may perhaps see in the course of a few days, and we mean\\nto take the opportunity of his help to go one night to the play. Martha\\nought to see the inside of the theatre once while she lives in\\nSouthampton, and I think she will hardly wish to take a second view.\\n\\nThe furniture of Bellevue is to be sold to-morrow, and we shall take it\\nin our usual walk, if the weather be favorable.\\n\\nHow could you have a wet day on Thursday? With us it was a prince of\\ndays, the most delightful we have had for weeks; soft, bright, with a\\nbrisk wind from the southwest; everybody was out and talking of spring,\\nand Martha and I did not know how to turn back. On Friday evening we had\\nsome very blowing weather,--from six to nine; I think we never heard it\\nworse, even here. And one night we had so much rain that it forced its\\nway again into the store-closet; and though the evil was comparatively\\nslight and the mischief nothing, I had some employment the next day in\\ndrying parcels, etc. I have now moved still more out of the way.\\n\\nMartha sends her best love, and thanks you for admitting her to the\\nknowledge of the pros and cons about Harriet Foote; she has an interest\\nin all such matters. I am also to say that she wants to see you. Mary\\nJane missed her papa and mamma a good deal at first, but now does very\\nwell without them. I am glad to hear of little John's being better, and\\nhope your accounts of Mrs. Knight will also improve. Adieu! remember me\\naffectionately to everybody, and believe me,\\n\\n                                                 Ever yours,      J.

       " '                                    CASTLE SQUARE, Friday (December 9).\\n\\nMANY thanks, my dear Cassandra, to you and Mr. Deedes for your joint and\\nagreeable composition, which took me by surprise this morning. He has\\ncertainly great merit as a writer; he does ample justice to his subject,\\nand without being diffuse is clear and correct; and though I do not\\nmean to compare his epistolary powers with yours, or to give him the\\nsame portion of my gratitude, he certainly has a very pleasing way of\\nwinding up a whole, and speeding truth into the world.\\n\\n\"But all this,\" as my dear Mrs. Piozzi says, \"is flight and fancy and\\nnonsense, for my master has his great casks to mind and I have my little\\nchildren.\" It is you, however, in this instance, that have the little\\nchildren, and I that have the great cask, for we are brewing spruce beer\\nagain; but my meaning really is, that I am extremely foolish in writing\\nall this unnecessary stuff when I have so many matters to write about\\nthat my paper will hardly hold it all. Little matters they are, to be\\nsure, but highly important.\\n\\nIn the first place, Miss Curling is actually at Portsmouth, which I was\\nalways in hopes would not happen. I wish her no worse, however, than a\\nlong and happy abode there. Here she would probably be dull, and I am\\nsure she would be troublesome.\\n\\nThe bracelets are in my possession, and everything I could wish them to\\nbe. They came with Martha\\'s pelisse, which likewise gives great\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\nSoon after I had closed my last letter to you we were visited by Mrs.\\nDickens and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bertie, the wife of a lately made\\nAdmiral. Mrs. F. A.,[8] I believe, was their first object, but they put\\nup with us very kindly, and Mrs. D., finding in Miss Lloyd a friend of\\nMrs. Dundas, had another motive for the acquaintance. She seems a really\\nagreeable woman,--that is, her manners are gentle, and she knows a great\\nmany of our connections in West Kent. Mrs. Bertie lives in the Polygon,\\nand was out when we returned her visit, which are her two virtues.\\n\\nA larger circle of acquaintance, and an increase of amusement, is quite\\nin character with our approaching removal. Yes, I mean to go to as many\\nballs as possible, that I may have a good bargain. Everybody is very\\nmuch concerned at our going away, and everybody is acquainted with\\nChawton, and speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village, and everybody\\nknows the house we describe, but nobody fixes on the right.\\n\\nI am very much obliged to Mrs. Knight for such a proof of the interest\\nshe takes in me, and she may depend upon it that I will marry Mr.\\nPapillon, whatever may be his reluctance or my own. I owe her much more\\nthan such a trifling sacrifice.\\n\\nOur ball was rather more amusing than I expected. Martha liked it very\\nmuch, and I did not gape till the last quarter of an hour. It was past\\nnine before we were sent for, and not twelve when we returned. The room\\nwas tolerably full, and there were, perhaps, thirty couple of dancers.\\nThe melancholy part was to see so many dozen young women standing by\\nwithout partners, and each of them with two ugly naked shoulders.\\n\\nIt was the same room in which we danced fifteen years ago. I thought it\\nall over, and in spite of the shame of being so much older, felt with\\nthankfulness that I was quite as happy now as then. We paid an\\nadditional shilling for our tea, which we took as we chose in an\\nadjoining and very comfortable room.\\n\\nThere were only four dances, and it went to my heart that the Miss\\nLances (one of them, too, named Emma) should have partners only for two.\\nYou will not expect to hear that I was asked to dance, but I was--by the\\ngentleman whom we met that Sunday with Captain D\\'Auvergne. We have\\nalways kept up a bowing acquaintance since, and, being pleased with his\\nblack eyes, I spoke to him at the ball, which brought on me this\\ncivility; but I do not know his name, and he seems so little at home in\\nthe English language that I believe his black eyes may be the best of\\nhim. Captain D\\'Auvergne has got a ship.\\n\\nMartha and I made use of the very favorable state of yesterday for\\nwalking, to pay our duty at Chiswell. We found Mrs. Lance at home and\\nalone, and sat out three other ladies who soon came in. We went by the\\nferry, and returned by the bridge, and were scarcely at all fatigued.\\n\\nEdward must have enjoyed the last two days. You, I presume, had a cool\\ndrive to Canterbury. Kitty Foote came on Wednesday; and her evening\\nvisit began early enough for the last part, the apple-pie, of our\\ndinner, for we never dine now till five.\\n\\nYesterday I--or rather, you--had a letter from Nanny Hilliard, the\\nobject of which is that she would be very much obliged to us if we would\\nget Hannah a place. I am sorry that I cannot assist her; if you can, let\\nme know, as I shall not answer the letter immediately. Mr. Sloper is\\nmarried again, not much to Nanny\\'s, or anybody\\'s satisfaction. The lady\\nwas governess to Sir Robert\\'s natural children, and seems to have\\nnothing to recommend her. I do not find, however, that Nanny is likely\\nto lose her place in consequence. She says not a word of what service\\nshe wishes for Hannah, or what Hannah can do; but a nursery, I suppose,\\nor something of that kind, must be the thing.\\n\\nHaving now cleared away my smaller articles of news, I come to a\\ncommunication of some weight; no less than that my uncle and aunt[9] are\\ngoing to allow James 100_l._ a year. We hear of it through Steventon.\\nMary sent us the other day an extract from my aunt\\'s letter on the\\nsubject, in which the donation is made with the greatest kindness, and\\nintended as a compensation for his loss in the conscientious refusal of\\nHampstead living; 100_l._ a year being all that he had at the time\\ncalled its worth, as I find it was always intended at Steventon to\\ndivide the real income with Kintbury.\\n\\nNothing can be more affectionate than my aunt\\'s language in making the\\npresent, and likewise in expressing her hope of their being much more\\ntogether in future than, to her great regret, they have of late years\\nbeen. My expectations for my mother do not rise with this event. We will\\nallow a little more time, however, before we fly out.\\n\\nIf not prevented by parish business, James comes to us on Monday. The\\nMrs. Hulberts and Miss Murden are their guests at present, and likely to\\ncontinue such till Christmas. Anna comes home on the 19th. The hundred a\\nyear begins next Lady-day.\\n\\nI am glad you are to have Henry with you again; with him and the boys\\nyou cannot but have a cheerful, and at times even a merry, Christmas.\\nMartha is so [_MSS. torn_]. . . . We want to be settled at Chawton in time\\nfor Henry to come to us for some shooting in October, at least, or a\\nlittle earlier, and Edward may visit us after taking his boys back to\\nWinchester. Suppose we name the 4th of September. Will not that do?\\n\\nI have but one thing more to tell you. Mrs. Hill called on my mother\\nyesterday while we were gone to Chiswell, and in the course of the\\nvisit asked her whether she knew anything of a clergyman\\'s family of the\\nname of Alford, who had resided in our part of Hampshire. Mrs. Hill had\\nbeen applied to as likely to give some information of them on account of\\ntheir probable vicinity to Dr. Hill\\'s living by a lady, or for a lady,\\nwho had known Mrs. and the two Miss Alfords in Bath, whither they had\\nremoved it seems from Hampshire, and who now wishes to convey to the\\nMiss Alfords some work or trimming which she has been doing for them;\\nbut the mother and daughters have left Bath, and the lady cannot learn\\nwhere they are gone to. While my mother gave us the account, the\\nprobability of its being ourselves occurred to us, and it had previously\\nstruck herself . . . what makes it more likely, and even indispensably\\nto be us, is that she mentioned Mr. Hammond as now having the living or\\ncuracy which the father had had. I cannot think who our kind lady can\\nbe, but I dare say we shall not like the work.\\n\\nDistribute the affectionate love of a heart not so tired as the right\\nhand belonging to it.\\n\\n                              Yours ever sincerely,          J. A.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[8] Frank Austen.\\n\\n[9] Mr. and Mrs. Leigh Perrot.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                                CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (December 27).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I can now write at leisure and make the most of my\\nsubjects, which is lucky, as they are not numerous this week.\\n\\nOur house was cleared by half-past eleven on Saturday, and we had the\\nsatisfaction of hearing yesterday that the party reached home in safety\\nsoon after five.\\n\\nI was very glad of your letter this morning; for, my mother taking\\nmedicine, Eliza keeping her bed with a cold, and Choles not coming, made\\nus rather dull and dependent on the post. You tell me much that gives me\\npleasure, but I think not much to answer. I wish I could help you in\\nyour needlework. I have two hands and a new thimble that lead a very\\neasy life.\\n\\nLady Sondes\\' match surprises, but does not offend me; had her first\\nmarriage been of affection, or had there been a grown-up single\\ndaughter, I should not have forgiven her; but I consider everybody as\\nhaving a right to marry once in their lives for love, if they can, and\\nprovided she will now leave off having bad headaches and being pathetic,\\nI can allow her, I can wish her, to be happy.\\n\\nDo not imagine that your picture of your _tête-à-tête_ with Sir B. makes\\nany change in our expectations here; he could not be really reading,\\nthough he held the newspaper in his hand; he was making up his mind to\\nthe deed, and the manner of it. I think you will have a letter from him\\nsoon.\\n\\nI heard from Portsmouth yesterday, and as I am to send them more\\nclothes, they cannot be expecting a very early return to us. Mary\\'s face\\nis pretty well, but she must have suffered a great deal with it; an\\nabscess was formed and opened.\\n\\nOur evening party on Thursday produced nothing more remarkable than Miss\\nMurden\\'s coming too, though she had declined it absolutely in the\\nmorning, and sitting very ungracious and very silent with us from seven\\no\\'clock till half after eleven, for so late was it, owing to the\\nchairmen, before we got rid of them.\\n\\nThe last hour, spent in yawning and shivering in a wide circle round the\\nfire, was dull enough, but the tray had admirable success. The widgeon\\nand the preserved ginger were as delicious as one could wish. But as to\\nour black butter, do not decoy anybody to Southampton by such a lure,\\nfor it is all gone. The first pot was opened when Frank and Mary were\\nhere, and proved not at all what it ought to be; it was neither solid\\nnor entirely sweet, and on seeing it, Eliza remembered that Miss Austen\\nhad said she did not think it had been boiled enough. It was made, you\\nknow, when we were absent. Such being the event of the first pot, I\\nwould not save the second, and we therefore ate it in unpretending\\nprivacy; and though not what it ought to be, part of it was very good.\\n\\nJames means to keep three horses on this increase of income; at present\\nhe has but one. Mary wishes the other two to be fit to carry women, and\\nin the purchase of one Edward will probably be called upon to fulfil his\\npromise to his godson. We have now pretty well ascertained James\\'s\\nincome to be eleven hundred pounds, curate paid, which makes us very\\nhappy,--the ascertainment as well as the income.\\n\\nMary does not talk of the garden; it may well be a disagreeable subject\\nto her, but her husband is persuaded that nothing is wanting to make the\\nfirst new one good but trenching, which is to be done by his own\\nservants and John Bond, by degrees, not at the expense which trenching\\nthe other amounted to.\\n\\nI was happy to hear, chiefly for Anna\\'s sake, that a ball at Manydown\\nwas once more in agitation; it is called a child\\'s ball, and given by\\nMrs. Heathcote to Wm. Such was its beginning at least, but it will\\nprobably swell into something more. Edward was invited during his stay\\nat Manydown, and it is to take place between this and Twelfth-day. Mrs.\\nHulbert has taken Anna a pair of white shoes on the occasion.\\n\\nI forgot in my last to tell you that we hear, by way of Kintbury and the\\nPalmers, that they were all well at Bermuda in the beginning of Nov.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--Yesterday must have been a day of sad remembrance at\\nGm.[10] I am glad it is over. We spent Friday evening with our friends at\\nthe boarding-house, and our curiosity was gratified by the sight of\\ntheir fellow-inmates, Mrs. Drew and Miss Hook, Mr. Wynne and Mr.\\nFitzhugh; the latter is brother to Mrs. Lance, and very much the\\ngentleman. He has lived in that house more than twenty years, and, poor\\nman! is so totally deaf that they say he could not hear a cannon, were\\nit fired close to him; having no cannon at hand to make the experiment,\\nI took it for granted, and talked to him a little with my fingers, which\\nwas funny enough. I recommended him to read \"Corinna.\"\\n\\nMiss Hook is a well-behaved, genteelish woman; Mrs. Drew well behaved,\\nwithout being at all genteel. Mr. Wynne seems a chatty and rather\\nfamiliar young man. Miss Murden was quite a different creature this last\\nevening from what she had been before, owing to her having with Martha\\'s\\nhelp found a situation in the morning, which bids very fair for comfort.\\nWhen she leaves Steventon, she comes to board and lodge with Mrs.\\nHookey, the chemist--for there is no Mr. Hookey. I cannot say that I am\\nin any hurry for the conclusion of her present visit, but I was truly\\nglad to see her comfortable in mind and spirits; at her age, perhaps,\\none may be as friendless oneself, and in similar circumstances quite as\\ncaptious.\\n\\nMy mother has been lately adding to her possessions in plate,--a whole\\ntablespoon and a whole dessert-spoon, and six whole teaspoons,--which\\nmakes our sideboard border on the magnificent. They were mostly the\\nproduce of old or useless silver. I have turned the 11_s._ in the list\\ninto 12_s._, and the card looks all the better; a silver tea-ladle is\\nalso added, which will at least answer the purpose of making us\\nsometimes think of John Warren.\\n\\nI have laid Lady Sondes\\' case before Martha, who does not make the least\\nobjection to it, and is particularly pleased with the name of Montresor.\\nI do not agree with her there, but I like his rank very much, and always\\naffix the ideas of strong sense and highly elegant manners to a general.\\n\\nI must write to Charles next week. You may guess in what extravagant\\nterms of praise Earle Harwood speaks of him. He is looked up to by\\neverybody in all America.\\n\\nI shall not tell you anything more of Wm. Digweed\\'s china, as your\\nsilence on the subject makes you unworthy of it. Mrs. H. Digweed looks\\nforward with great satisfaction to our being her neighbors. I would\\nhave her enjoy the idea to the utmost, as I suspect there will not be\\nmuch in the reality. With equal pleasure we anticipate an intimacy with\\nher husband\\'s bailiff and his wife, who live close by us, and are said\\nto be remarkably good sort of people.\\n\\nYes, yes, we will have a pianoforte, as good a one as can be got for\\nthirty guineas, and I will practise country dances, that we may have\\nsome amusement for our nephews and nieces, when we have the pleasure of\\ntheir company.\\n\\nMartha sends her love to Henry, and tells him that he will soon have a\\nbill of Miss Chaplin\\'s, about 14_l._, to pay on her account; but the\\nbill shall not be sent in till his return to town. I hope he comes to\\nyou in good health, and in spirits as good as a first return to\\nGodmersham can allow. With his nephews he will force himself to be\\ncheerful, till he really is so. Send me some intelligence of Eliza; it\\nis a long while since I have heard of her.\\n\\nWe have had snow on the ground here almost a week; it is now going, but\\nSouthampton must boast no longer. We all send our love to Edward junior\\nand his brothers, and I hope Speculation is generally liked.\\n\\nFare you well.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\n                                                        J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nMy mother has not been out of doors this week, but she keeps pretty\\nwell. We have received through Bookham an indifferent account of your\\ngodmother.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[10] Godmersham, Edward Austen\\'s place.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                            CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 10, 1809).\\n\\nI AM not surprised, my dear Cassandra, that you did not find my last\\nletter very full of matter, and I wish this may not have the same\\ndeficiency; but we are doing nothing ourselves to write about, and I am\\ntherefore quite dependent upon the communications of our friends, or my\\nown wits.\\n\\nThis post brought me two interesting letters, yours and one from\\nBookham, in answer to an inquiry of mine about your good godmother, of\\nwhom we had lately received a very alarming account from Paragon. Miss\\nArnold was the informant then, and she spoke of Mrs. E. L. having been\\nvery dangerously ill, and attended by a physician from Oxford.\\n\\nYour letter to Adlestrop may perhaps bring you information from the\\nspot, but in case it should not, I must tell you that she is better;\\nthough Dr. Bourne cannot yet call her out of danger; such was the case\\nlast Wednesday, and Mrs. Cooke\\'s having had no later account is a\\nfavorable sign. I am to hear again from the latter next week, but not\\nthis, if everything goes on well.\\n\\nHer disorder is an inflammation on the lungs, arising from a severe\\nchill taken in church last Sunday three weeks; her mind all pious\\ncomposure, as may be supposed. George Cooke was there when her illness\\nbegan; his brother has now taken his place. Her age and feebleness\\nconsidered, one\\'s fears cannot but preponderate, though her amendment\\nhas already surpassed the expectation of the physician at the beginning.\\nI am sorry to add that Becky is laid up with a complaint of the same\\nkind.\\n\\nI am very glad to have the time of your return at all fixed; we all\\nrejoice in it, and it will not be later than I had expected. I dare not\\nhope that Mary and Miss Curling may be detained at Portsmouth so long or\\nhalf so long; but it would be worth twopence to have it so.\\n\\nThe \"St. Albans\" perhaps may soon be off to help bring home what may\\nremain by this time of our poor army, whose state seems dreadfully\\ncritical. The \"Regency\" seems to have been heard of only here; my most\\npolitical correspondents make no mention of it. Unlucky that I should\\nhave wasted so much reflection on the subject.\\n\\nI can now answer your question to my mother more at large, and likewise\\nmore at small--with equal perspicuity and minuteness; for the very day\\nof our leaving Southampton is fixed; and if the knowledge is of no use\\nto Edward, I am sure it will give him pleasure. Easter Monday, April 3,\\nis the day; we are to sleep that night at Alton, and be with our friends\\nat Bookham the next, if they are then at home; there we remain till the\\nfollowing Monday, and on Tuesday, April 11, hope to be at Godmersham. If\\nthe Cookes are absent, we shall finish our journey on the 5th. These\\nplans depend of course upon the weather, but I hope there will be no\\nsettled cold to delay us materially.\\n\\nTo make you amends for being at Bookham, it is in contemplation to spend\\na few days at Baiton Lodge in our way out of Kent. The hint of such a\\nvisit is most affectionately welcomed by Mrs. Birch, in one of her odd\\npleasant letters lately, in which she speaks of us with the usual\\ndistinguished kindness, declaring that she shall not be at all satisfied\\nunless a very handsome present is made us immediately from one quarter.\\n\\nFanny\\'s not coming with you is no more than we expected; and as we have\\nnot the hope of a bed for her, and shall see her so soon afterwards at\\nGodmersham, we cannot wish it otherwise.\\n\\nWilliam will be quite recovered, I trust, by the time you receive this.\\nWhat a comfort his cross-stitch must have been! Pray tell him that I\\nshould like to see his work very much. I hope our answers this morning\\nhave given satisfaction; we had great pleasure in Uncle Deedes\\' packet;\\nand pray let Marianne know, in private, that I think she is quite right\\nto work a rug for Uncle John\\'s coffee urn, and that I am sure it must\\ngive great pleasure to herself now, and to him when he receives it.\\n\\nThe preference of Brag over Speculation does not greatly surprise me, I\\nbelieve, because I feel the same myself; but it mortifies me deeply,\\nbecause Speculation was under my patronage; and, after all, what is\\nthere so delightful in a pair royal of Braggers? It is but three nines\\nor three knaves, or a mixture of them. When one comes to reason upon it,\\nit cannot stand its ground against Speculation,--of which I hope Edward\\nis now convinced. Give my love to him if he is.\\n\\nThe letter from Paragon before mentioned was much like those which had\\npreceded it, as to the felicity of its writer. They found their house so\\ndirty and so damp that they were obliged to be a week at an inn. John\\nBinns had behaved most unhandsomely, and engaged himself elsewhere. They\\nhave a man, however, on the same footing, which my aunt does not like,\\nand she finds both him and the new maid-servant very, very inferior to\\nRobert and Martha. Whether they mean to have any other domestics does\\nnot appear, nor whether they are to have a carriage while they are in\\nBath.\\n\\nThe Holders are as usual, though I believe it is not very usual for them\\nto be happy, which they now are at a great rate, in Hooper\\'s marriage.\\nThe Irvines are not mentioned. The American lady improved as we went on;\\nbut still the same faults in part recurred.\\n\\nWe are now in Margiana, and like it very well indeed. We are just going\\nto set off for Northumberland to be shut up in Widdrington Tower, where\\nthere must be two or three sets of victims already immured under a very\\nfine villain.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--Your report of Eliza\\'s health gives me great pleasure, and\\nthe progress of the bank is a constant source of satisfaction. With such\\nincreasing profits, tell Henry that I hope he will not work poor\\nHigh-Diddle so hard as he used to do.\\n\\nHas your newspaper given a sad story of a Mrs. Middleton, wife of a\\nfarmer in Yorkshire, her sister, and servant, being almost frozen to\\ndeath in the late weather, her little child quite so? I hope the sister\\nis not our friend Miss Woodd, and I rather think her brother-in-law had\\nmoved into Lincolnshire, but their name and station accord too well.\\nMrs. M. and the maid are said to be tolerably recovered, but the sister\\nis likely to lose the use of her limbs.\\n\\nCharles\\'s rug will be finished to-day, and sent to-morrow to Frank, to\\nbe consigned by him to Mr. Turner\\'s care; and I am going to send Marmion\\nout with it,--very generous in me, I think.\\n\\nAs we have no letter from Adlestrop, we may suppose the good woman was\\nalive on Monday, but I cannot help expecting bad news from thence or\\nBookham in a few days. Do you continue quite well?\\n\\nHave you nothing to say of your little namesake? We join in love and\\nmany happy returns.\\n\\n                               Yours affectionately,       J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nThe Manydown ball was a smaller thing than I expected, but it seems to\\nhave made Anna very happy. At her age it would not have done for me.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                                 CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 17).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am happy to say that we had no second letter from\\nBookham last week. Yours has brought its usual measure of satisfaction\\nand amusement, and I beg your acceptance of all the thanks due on the\\noccasion. Your offer of cravats is very kind, and happens to be\\nparticularly adapted to my wants, but it was an odd thing to occur to\\nyou.\\n\\nYes, we have got another fall of snow, and are very dreadful; everything\\nseems to turn to snow this winter.\\n\\nI hope you have had no more illness among you, and that William will be\\nsoon as well as ever. His working a footstool for Chawton is a most\\nagreeable surprise to me, and I am sure his grandmamma will value it\\nvery much as a proof of his affection and industry, but we shall never\\nhave the heart to put our feet upon it. I believe I must work a muslin\\ncover in satin stitch to keep it from the dirt. I long to know what his\\ncolors are. I guess greens and purples.\\n\\nEdward and Henry have started a difficulty respecting our journey,\\nwhich, I must own with some confusion, had never been thought of by us;\\nbut if the former expected by it to prevent our travelling into Kent\\nentirely, he will be disappointed, for we have already determined to go\\nthe Croydon road on leaving Bookham and sleep at Dartford. Will not that\\ndo? There certainly does seem no convenient resting-place on the other\\nroad.\\n\\nAnna went to Clanville last Friday, and I have hopes of her new aunt\\'s\\nbeing really worth her knowing. Perhaps you may never have heard that\\nJames and Mary paid a morning visit there in form some weeks ago, and\\nMary, though by no means disposed to like her, was very much pleased\\nwith her indeed. Her praise, to be sure, proves nothing more than Mrs.\\nM.\\'s being civil and attentive to them, but her being so is in favor of\\nher having good sense. Mary writes of Anna as improved in person, but\\ngives her no other commendation. I am afraid her absence now may deprive\\nher of one pleasure, for that silly Mr. Hammond is actually to give his\\nball on Friday.\\n\\nWe had some reason to expect a visit from Earle Harwood and James this\\nweek, but they do not come. Miss Murden arrived last night at Mrs.\\nHookey\\'s, as a message and a basket announced to us. You will therefore\\nreturn to an enlarged and, of course, improved society here, especially\\nas the Miss Williamses are come back.\\n\\nWe were agreeably surprised the other day by a visit from your beauty\\nand mine, each in a new cloth mantle and bonnet; and I dare say you will\\nvalue yourself much on the modest propriety of Miss W.\\'s taste, hers\\nbeing purple and Miss Grace\\'s scarlet.\\n\\nI can easily suppose that your six weeks here will be fully occupied,\\nwere it only in lengthening the waists of your gowns. I have pretty well\\narranged my spring and summer plans of that kind, and mean to wear out\\nmy spotted muslin before I go. You will exclaim at this, but mine really\\nhas signs of feebleness, which with a little care may come to\\nsomething.\\n\\nMartha and Dr. Mant are as bad as ever; he runs after her in the street\\nto apologize for having spoken to a gentleman while she was near him the\\nday before. Poor Mrs. Mant can stand it no longer; she is retired to one\\nof her married daughters\\'.\\n\\nWhen William returns to Winchester Mary Jane is to go to Mrs. Nune\\'s for\\na month, and then to Steventon for a fortnight, and it seems likely that\\nshe and her aunt Martha may travel into Berkshire together.\\n\\nWe shall not have a month of Martha after your return, and that month\\nwill be a very interrupted and broken one, but we shall enjoy ourselves\\nthe more when we can get a quiet half-hour together.\\n\\nTo set against your new novel, of which nobody ever heard before, and\\nperhaps never may again, we have got \"Ida of Athens,\" by Miss Owenson,\\nwhich must be very clever, because it was written, as the authoress\\nsays, in three months. We have only read the preface yet, but her Irish\\ngirl does not make me expect much. If the warmth of her language could\\naffect the body, it might be worth reading in this weather.\\n\\nAdieu! I must leave off to stir the fire and call on Miss Murden.\\n\\n_Evening._--I have done them both, the first very often. We found our\\nfriend as comfortable as she can ever allow herself to be in cold\\nweather. There is a very neat parlor behind the shop for her to sit in,\\nnot very light indeed, being _à la_ Southampton, the middle of three\\ndeep, but very lively from the frequent sound of the pestle and mortar.\\n\\nWe afterwards called on the Miss Williamses, who lodge at Durantoy\\'s.\\nMiss Mary only was at home, and she is in very indifferent health. Dr.\\nHacket came in while we were there, and said that he never remembered\\nsuch a severe winter as this in Southampton before. It is bad, but we do\\nnot suffer as we did last year, because the wind has been more N.E. than\\nN.W.\\n\\nFor a day or two last week my mother was very poorly with a return of\\none of her old complaints, but it did not last long, and seems to have\\nleft nothing bad behind it. She began to talk of a serious illness, her\\ntwo last having been preceded by the same symptoms, but, thank heaven!\\nshe is now quite as well as one can expect her to be in weather which\\ndeprives her of exercise.\\n\\nMiss M. conveys to us a third volume of sermons, from Hamstall, just\\npublished, and which we are to like better than the two others; they are\\nprofessedly practical, and for the use of country congregations. I have\\njust received some verses in an unknown hand, and am desired to forward\\nthem to my nephew Edward at Godmersham.\\n\\n    Alas! poor Brag, thou boastful game!\\n    What now avails thine empty name?\\n    Where now thy more distinguished fame?\\n    My day is o\\'er, and thine the same,\\n    For thou, like me, art thrown aside\\n    At Godmersham, this Christmastide;\\n    And now across the table wide\\n    Each game save brag or spec. is tried.\\n    Such is the mild ejaculation\\n    Of tender-hearted speculation.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--I expected to have a letter from somebody to-day, but I\\nhave not. Twice every day I think of a letter from Portsmouth.\\n\\nMiss Murden has been sitting with us this morning. As yet she seems very\\nwell pleased with her situation. The worst part of her being in\\nSouthampton will be the necessity of one walking with her now and then,\\nfor she talks so loud that one is quite ashamed; but our dining hours\\nare luckily very different, which we shall take all reasonable advantage\\nof.\\n\\nThe Queen\\'s birthday moves the assembly to this night instead of last,\\nand as it is always fully attended, Martha and I expect an amusing show.\\nWe were in hopes of being independent of other companions by having the\\nattendance of Mr. Austen and Captain Harwood; but as they fail us, we\\nare obliged to look out for other help, and have fixed on the Wallops as\\nleast likely to be troublesome. I have called on them this morning and\\nfound them very willing, and I am sorry that you must wait a whole week\\nfor the particulars of the evening. I propose being asked to dance by\\nour acquaintance Mr. Smith, now _Captain_ Smith, who has lately\\nreappeared in Southampton, but I shall decline it. He saw Charles last\\nAugust.\\n\\nWhat an alarming bride Mrs. ---- must have been; such a parade is one of\\nthe most immodest pieces of modesty that one can imagine. To attract\\nnotice could have been her only wish. It augurs ill for her family; it\\nannounces not great sense, and therefore insures boundless influence.\\n\\nI hope Fanny\\'s visit is now taking place. You have said scarcely\\nanything of her lately, but I trust you are as good friends as ever.\\n\\nMartha sends her love, and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you when\\nyou return to Southampton. You are to understand this message as being\\nmerely for the sake of a message to oblige me.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\n                                                      J.

       " '                                  CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 24).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I will give you the indulgence of a letter on\\nThursday this week, instead of Friday, but I do not require you to write\\nagain before Sunday, provided I may believe you and your finger going on\\nquite well. Take care of your precious self; do not work too hard.\\nRemember that Aunt Cassandras are quite as scarce as Miss Beverleys.[11]\\n\\nI had the happiness yesterday of a letter from Charles, but I shall say\\nas little about it as possible, because I know that excruciating Henry\\nwill have had a letter likewise, to make all my intelligence valueless.\\nIt was written at Bermuda on the 7th and 10th of December. All well, and\\nFanny still only in expectation of being otherwise. He had taken a small\\nprize in his late cruise,--a French schooner, laden with sugar; but bad\\nweather parted them, and she had not yet been heard of. His cruise ended\\nDecember 1st. My September letter was the latest he had received.\\n\\nThis day three weeks you are to be in London, and I wish you better\\nweather; not but that you may have worse, for we have now nothing but\\nceaseless snow or rain and insufferable dirt to complain of; no\\ntempestuous winds nor severity of cold. Since I wrote last we have had\\nsomething of each, but it is not genteel to rip up old grievances.\\n\\nYou used me scandalously by not mentioning Edward Cooper\\'s sermons. I\\ntell you everything, and it is unknown the mysteries you conceal from\\nme; and, to add to the rest, you persevere in giving a final \"e\" to\\n\"invalid,\" thereby putting it out of one\\'s power to suppose Mrs. E.\\nLeigh, even for a moment, a veteran soldier. She, good woman, is, I\\nhope, destined for some further placid enjoyment of her own excellence\\nin this world, for her recovery advances exceedingly well.\\n\\nI had this pleasant news in a letter from Bookham last Thursday; but as\\nthe letter was from Mary instead of her mother, you will guess her\\naccount was not equally good from home. Mrs. Cooke had been confined to\\nher bed some days by illness, but was then better, and Mary wrote in\\nconfidence of her continuing to mend. I have desired to hear again soon.\\n\\nYou rejoice me by what you say of Fanny.[12] I hope she will not turn\\ngood-for-nothing this ever so long. We thought of and talked of her\\nyesterday with sincere affection, and wished her a long enjoyment of all\\nthe happiness to which she seems born. While she gives happiness to\\nthose about her she is pretty sure of her own share.\\n\\nI am gratified by her having pleasure in what I write, but I wish the\\nknowledge of my being exposed to her discerning criticism may not hurt\\nmy style, by inducing too great a solicitude. I begin already to weigh\\nmy words and sentences more than I did, and am looking about for a\\nsentiment, an illustration, or a metaphor in every corner of the room.\\nCould my ideas flow as fast as the rain in the store-closet, it would be\\ncharming.\\n\\nWe have been in two or three dreadful states within the last week, from\\nthe melting of the snow, etc., and the contest between us and the closet\\nhas now ended in our defeat. I have been obliged to move almost\\neverything out of it, and leave it to splash itself as it likes.\\n\\nYou have by no means raised my curiosity after Caleb. My disinclination\\nfor it before was affected, but now it is real. I do not like the\\nevangelicals. Of course I shall be delighted when I read it, like other\\npeople; but till I do I dislike it.\\n\\nI am sorry my verses did not bring any return from Edward. I was in\\nhopes they might, but I suppose he does not rate them high enough. It\\nmight be partiality, but they seemed to me purely classical,--just like\\nHomer and Virgil, Ovid and Propria que Maribus.\\n\\nI had a nice brotherly letter from Frank the other day, which, after an\\ninterval of nearly three weeks, was very welcome. No orders were come on\\nFriday, and none were come yesterday, or we should have heard to-day. I\\nhad supposed Miss C. would share her cousin\\'s room here, but a message\\nin this letter proves the contrary. I will make the garret as\\ncomfortable as I can, but the possibilities of that apartment are not\\ngreat.\\n\\nMy mother has been talking to Eliza about our future home, and she,\\nmaking no difficulty at all of the sweetheart, is perfectly disposed to\\ncontinue with us, but till she has written home for mother\\'s approbation\\ncannot quite decide. Mother does not like to have her so far off. At\\nChawton she will be nine or ten miles nearer, which I hope will have its\\ndue influence.\\n\\nAs for Sally, she means to play John Binns with us, in her anxiety to\\nbelong to our household again. Hitherto she appears a very good servant.\\n\\nYou depend upon finding all your plants dead, I hope. They look very\\nill, I understand.\\n\\nYour silence on the subject of our ball makes me suppose your curiosity\\ntoo great for words. We were very well entertained, and could have\\nstayed longer but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home,\\nand I did not like to keep them waiting in the cold. The room was\\ntolerably full, and the ball opened by Miss Glyn. The Miss Lances had\\npartners, Captain Dauvergne\\'s friend appeared in regimentals, Caroline\\nMaitland had an officer to flirt with, and Mr. John Harrison was deputed\\nby Captain Smith, being himself absent, to ask me to dance. Everything\\nwent well, you see, especially after we had tucked Mrs. Lance\\'s\\nneckerchief in behind and fastened it with a pin.\\n\\nWe had a very full and agreeable account of Mr. Hammond\\'s ball from Anna\\nlast night; the same fluent pen has sent similar information, I know,\\ninto Kent. She seems to have been as happy as one could wish her, and\\nthe complacency of her mamma in doing the honors of the evening must\\nhave made her pleasure almost as great. The grandeur of the meeting was\\nbeyond my hopes. I should like to have seen Anna\\'s looks and\\nperformance, but that sad cropped head must have injured the former.\\n\\nMartha pleases herself with believing that if I had kept her counsel you\\nwould never have heard of Dr. M.\\'s late behavior, as if the very slight\\nmanner in which I mentioned it could have been all on which you found\\nyour judgment. I do not endeavor to undeceive her, because I wish her\\nhappy, at all events, and know how highly she prizes happiness of any\\nkind. She is, moreover, so full of kindness for us both, and sends you\\nin particular so many good wishes about your finger, that I am willing\\nto overlook a venial fault, and as Dr. M. is a clergyman, their\\nattachment, however immoral, has a decorous air. Adieu, sweet You. This\\nis grievous news from Spain. It is well that Dr. Moore was spared the\\nknowledge of such a son\\'s death.\\n\\n                                Yours affectionately,      J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nAnna\\'s hand gets better and better; it begins to be too good for any\\nconsequence.\\n\\nWe send best love to dear little Lizzy and Marianne in particular.\\n\\nThe Portsmouth paper gave a melancholy history of a poor mad woman,\\nescaped from confinement, who said her husband and daughter, of the name\\nof Payne, lived at Ashford, in Kent. Do you own them?\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[11] \"Cecilia\" Beverley, the heroine of Miss Burney\\'s novel.\\n\\n[12] Fanny Austen, afterward Lady Edward Knatchbull.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I wish the poor little girls\\nhad better weather for their journey; they must amuse themselves with\\nwatching the raindrops down the windows. Sackree, I suppose, feels quite\\nbroken-hearted. I cannot have done with the weather without observing\\nhow delightfully mild it is; I am sure Fanny must enjoy it with us.\\nYesterday was a very blowing day; we got to church, however, which we\\nhad not been able to do for two Sundays before.\\n\\nI am not at all ashamed about the name of the novel, having been guilty\\nof no insult toward your handwriting; the diphthong I always saw, but\\nknowing how fond you were of adding a vowel wherever you could, I\\nattributed it to that alone, and the knowledge of the truth does the\\nbook no service; the only merit it could have was in the name of Caleb,\\nwhich has an honest, unpretending sound, but in Coelebs there is\\npedantry and affectation. Is it written only to classical scholars?\\n\\nI shall now try to say only what is necessary, I am weary of meandering;\\nso expect a vast deal of small matter, concisely told, in the next two\\npages.\\n\\nMrs. Cooke has been very dangerously ill, but is now, I hope, safe. I\\nhad a letter last week from George, Mary being too busy to write, and at\\nthat time the disorder was called of the typhus kind, and their alarm\\nconsiderable, but yesterday brought me a much better account from Mary,\\nthe origin of the complaint being now ascertained to be bilious, and the\\nstrong medicines requisite promising to be effectual. Mrs. E. L. is so\\nmuch recovered as to get into the dressing-room every day.\\n\\nA letter from Hamstall gives us the history of Sir Tho. Williams\\'s\\nreturn. The Admiral, whoever he might he, took a fancy to the \"Neptune,\"\\nand having only a worn-out 74 to offer in lieu of it, Sir Tho. declined\\nsuch a command, and is come home passenger. Lucky man! to have so fair\\nan opportunity of escape. I hope his wife allows herself to be happy on\\nthe occasion, and does not give all her thoughts to being nervous.\\n\\nA great event happens this week at Hamstall in young Edward\\'s removal to\\nschool. He is going to Rugby, and is very happy in the idea of it; I\\nwish his happiness may last, but it will be a great change to become a\\nraw school-boy from being a pompous sermon-writer and a domineering\\nbrother. It will do him good, I dare say.\\n\\nCaroline has had a great escape from being burnt to death lately. As her\\nhusband gives the account, we must believe it true. Miss Murden is\\ngone,--called away by the critical state of Mrs. Pottinger who has had\\nanother severe stroke, and is without sense or speech. Miss Murden\\nwishes to return to Southampton if circumstances suit, but it must be\\nvery doubtful.\\n\\nWe have been obliged to turn away Cholles, he grew so very drunken and\\nnegligent, and we have a man in his place called Thomas.\\n\\nMartha desires me to communicate something concerning herself which she\\nknows will give you pleasure, as affording her very particular\\nsatisfaction,--it is that she is to be in town this spring with Mrs.\\nDundas. I need not dilate on the subject. You understand enough of the\\nwhys and wherefores to enter into her feelings, and to be conscious that\\nof all possible arrangements it is the one most acceptable to her. She\\ngoes to Barton on leaving us, and the family remove to town in April.\\n\\nWhat you tell me of Miss Sharpe is quite new, and surprises me a little;\\nI feel, however, as you do. She is born, poor thing! to struggle with\\nevil, and her continuing with Miss B. is, I hope, a proof that matters\\nare not always so very bad between them as her letters sometimes\\nrepresent.\\n\\nJenny\\'s marriage I had heard of, and supposed you would do so too from\\nSteventon, as I knew you were corresponding with Mary at the time. I\\nhope she will not sully the respectable name she now bears.\\n\\nYour plan for Miss Curling is uncommonly considerate and friendly, and\\nsuch as she must surely jump at. Edward\\'s going round by Steventon, as I\\nunderstand he promises to do, can be no reasonable objection; Mrs. J.\\nAusten\\'s hospitality is just of the kind to enjoy such a visitor.\\n\\nWe were very glad to know Aunt Fanny was in the country when we read of\\nthe fire. Pray give my best compliments to the Mrs. Finches, if they are\\nat Gm. I am sorry to find that Sir J. Moore has a mother living, but\\nthough a very heroic son he might not be a very necessary one to her\\nhappiness. Deacon Morrell may be more to Mrs. Morrell.\\n\\nI wish Sir John had united something of the Christian with the hero in\\nhis death. Thank heaven! we have had no one to care for particularly\\namong the troops,--no one, in fact, nearer to us than Sir John himself.\\nCol. Maitland is safe and well; his mother and sisters were of course\\nanxious about him, but there is no entering much into the solicitudes of\\nthat family.\\n\\nMy mother is well, and gets out when she can with the same enjoyment,\\nand apparently the same strength, as hitherto. She hopes you will not\\nomit begging Mrs. Seward to get the garden cropped for us, supposing she\\nleaves the house too early to make the garden any object to herself. We\\nare very desirous of receiving your account of the house, for your\\nobservations will have a motive which can leave nothing to conjecture\\nand suffer nothing from want of memory. For one\\'s own dear self, one\\nascertains and remembers everything.\\n\\nLady Sondes is an impudent woman to come back into her old neighborhood\\nagain; I suppose she pretends never to have married before, and wonders\\nhow her father and mother came to have her christened Lady Sondes.\\n\\nThe store-closet, I hope, will never do so again, for much of the evil\\nis proved to have proceeded from the gutter being choked up, and we have\\nhad it cleared. We had reason to rejoice in the child\\'s absence at the\\ntime of the thaw, for the nursery was not habitable. We hear of similar\\ndisasters from almost everybody.\\n\\nNo news from Portsmouth. We are very patient. Mrs. Charles Fowle desires\\nto be kindly remembered to you.

       " '                                  SLOANE ST., Thursday (April 18, 1811).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I have so many little matters to tell you of, that I\\ncannot wait any longer before I begin to put them down. I spent Tuesday\\nin Bentinck Street. The Cookes called here and took me back, and it was\\nquite a Cooke day, for the Miss Rolles paid a visit while I was there,\\nand Sam Arnold dropped in to tea.\\n\\nThe badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine,--that\\nof calling on Miss Beckford again; but from the middle of the day it\\nrained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing of her father and\\nmother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had\\nsome amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always\\ninclines me to attend more to the company than the sight.\\n\\nMrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called;\\nit was owing to a blunder among the servants, for she did not know of\\nour visit till we were gone. She seems tolerably well, but the nervous\\npart of her complaint, I fear, increases, and makes her more and more\\nunwilling to part with Mary.\\n\\nI have proposed to the latter that she should go to Chawton with me, on\\nthe supposition of my travelling the Guildford road, and she, I do\\nbelieve, would be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;\\nunless a brother can be at home at that time, it certainly must. George\\ncomes to them to-day.\\n\\nI did not see Theo. till late on Tuesday; he was gone to Ilford, but he\\ncame back in time to show his usual nothing-meaning, harmless, heartless\\ncivility. Henry, who had been confined the whole day to the bank, took\\nme in his way home, and, after putting life and wit into the party for a\\nquarter of an hour, put himself and his sister into a hackney coach.\\n\\nI bless my stars that I have done with Tuesday. But, alas! Wednesday was\\nlikewise a day of great doings, for Manon and I took our walk to Grafton\\nHouse, and I have a good deal to say on that subject.\\n\\nI am sorry to tell you that I am getting very extravagant, and spending\\nall my money, and, what is worse for you, I have been spending yours\\ntoo; for in a linendraper\\'s shop to which I went for checked muslin, and\\nfor which I was obliged to give seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by\\na pretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it on the chance of\\nyour liking it; but at the same time, if it should not suit you, you\\nmust not think yourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3_s._\\n6_d._ per yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping the whole. In\\ntexture it is just what we prefer, but its resemblance to green crewels,\\nI must own, is not great, for the pattern is a small red spot. And now I\\nbelieve I have done all my commissions except Wedgwood.\\n\\nI liked my walk very much; it was shorter than I had expected, and the\\nweather was delightful. We set off immediately after breakfast, and must\\nhave reached Grafton House by half-past eleven; but when we entered the\\nshop the whole counter was thronged, and we waited full half an hour\\nbefore we could be attended to. When we were served, however, I was\\nvery well satisfied with my purchases,--my bugle trimming at 2_s._ 4_d._\\nand three pair silk stockings for a little less than 12_s._ a pair.\\n\\nIn my way back who should I meet but Mr. Moore, just come from\\nBeckenham. I believe he would have passed me if I had not made him stop,\\nbut we were delighted to meet. I soon found, however, that he had\\nnothing new to tell me, and then I let him go.\\n\\nMiss Burton has made me a very pretty little bonnet, and now nothing can\\nsatisfy me but I must have a straw hat, of the riding-hat shape, like\\nMrs. Tilson\\'s; and a young woman in this neighborhood is actually making\\nme one. I am really very shocking, but it will not be dear at a guinea.\\nOur pelisses are 17_s._ each; she charges only 8_s._ for the making, but\\nthe buttons seem expensive,--are expensive, I might have said, for the\\nfact is plain enough.\\n\\nWe drank tea again yesterday with the Tilsons, and met the Smiths. I\\nfind all these little parties very pleasant. I like Mrs. S.; Miss Beaty\\nis good-humor itself, and does not seem much besides. We spend to-morrow\\nevening with them, and are to meet the Coln. and Mrs. Cantelo Smith you\\nhave been used to hear of, and, if she is in good humor, are likely to\\nhave excellent singing.\\n\\nTo-night I might have been at the play; Henry had kindly planned our\\ngoing together to the Lyceum, but I have a cold which I should not like\\nto make worse before Saturday, so I stay within all this day.\\n\\nEliza is walking out by herself. She has plenty of business on her hands\\njust now, for the day of the party is settled, and drawing near. Above\\neighty people are invited for next Tuesday evening, and there is to be\\nsome very good music,--five professionals, three of them glee singers,\\nbesides amateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings is a\\nCapital on the harp, from which I expect great pleasure. The foundation\\nof the party was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter, but the\\nlatter leaves town the day before. I am sorry, as I wished her prejudice\\nto be done away, but should have been more sorry if there had been no\\ninvitation.\\n\\nI am a wretch, to be so occupied with all these things as to seem to\\nhave no thoughts to give to people and circumstances which really supply\\na far more lasting interest,--the society in which you are; but I do\\nthink of you all, I assure you, and want to know all about everybody,\\nand especially about your visit to the W. Friars; _mais le moyen_ not to\\nbe occupied by one\\'s own concerns?\\n\\n_Saturday._--Frank is superseded in the \"Caledonia.\" Henry brought us\\nthis news yesterday from Mr. Daysh, and he heard at the same time that\\nCharles may be in England in the course of a month. Sir Edward Pollen\\nsucceeds Lord Gambier in his command, and some captain of his succeeds\\nFrank; and I believe the order is already gone out. Henry means to\\ninquire further to-day. He wrote to Mary on the occasion. This is\\nsomething to think of. Henry is convinced that he will have the offer of\\nsomething else, but does not think it will be at all incumbent on him to\\naccept it; and then follows, what will he do? and where will he live?\\n\\nI hope to hear from you to-day. How are you as to health, strength,\\nlooks, etc.? I had a very comfortable account from Chawton yesterday.\\n\\nIf the weather permits, Eliza and I walk into London this morning. She\\nis in want of chimney lights for Tuesday, and I of an ounce of\\ndarning-cotton. She has resolved not to venture to the play to-night.\\nThe D\\'Entraigues and Comte Julien cannot come to the party, which was at\\nfirst a grief, but she has since supplied herself so well with\\nperformers that it is of no consequence; their not coming has produced\\nour going to them to-morrow evening, which I like the idea of. It will\\nbe amusing to see the ways of a French circle.\\n\\nI wrote to Mrs. Hill a few days ago, and have received a most kind and\\nsatisfactory answer. Any time the first week in May exactly suits her,\\nand therefore I consider my going as tolerably fixed. I shall leave\\nSloane Street on the 1st or 2d, and be ready for James on the 9th, and,\\nif his plan alters, I can take care of myself. I have explained my views\\nhere, and everything is smooth and pleasant; and Eliza talks kindly of\\nconveying me to Streatham.\\n\\nWe met the Tilsons yesterday evening, but the singing Smiths sent an\\nexcuse, which put our Mrs. Smith out of humor.\\n\\nWe are come back, after a good dose of walking and coaching, and I have\\nthe pleasure of your letter. I wish I had James\\'s verses, but they were\\nleft at Chawton. When I return thither, if Mrs. K. will give me leave, I\\nwill send them to her.\\n\\nOur first object to-day was Henrietta St., to consult with Henry in\\nconsequence of a very unlucky change of the play for this very\\nnight,--\"Hamlet\" instead of \"King John,\"--and we are to go on Monday to\\n\"Macbeth\" instead; but it is a disappointment to us both.\\n\\nLove to all.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\n                                                    JANE.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                                  SLOANE ST., Thursday (April 25).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I can return the compliment by thanking you for\\nthe unexpected pleasure of your letter yesterday, and as I like\\nunexpected pleasure, it made me very happy; and, indeed, you need not\\napologize for your letter in any respect, for it is all very fine, but\\nnot too fine, I hope, to be written again, or something like it.\\n\\nI think Edward will not suffer much longer from heat; by the look of\\nthings this morning I suspect the weather is rising into the balsamic\\nnorth-east. It has been hot here, as you may suppose, since it was so\\nhot with you, but I have not suffered from it at all, nor felt it in\\nsuch a degree as to make me imagine it would be anything in the country.\\nEverybody has talked of the heat, but I set it all down to London.\\n\\nI give you joy of our new nephew, and hope if he ever comes to be hanged\\nit will not be till we are too old to care about it. It is a great\\ncomfort to have it so safely and speedily over. The Miss Curlings must\\nbe hard worked in writing so many letters, but the novelty of it may\\nrecommend it to them; mine was from Miss Eliza, and she says that my\\nbrother may arrive to-day.\\n\\nNo, indeed, I am never too busy to think of S. and S.[13] I can no more\\nforget it than a mother can forget her sucking child; and I am much\\nobliged to you for your inquiries. I have had two sheets to correct, but\\nthe last only brings us to Willoughby\\'s first appearance. Mrs. K.\\nregrets in the most flattering manner that she must wait till May, but I\\nhave scarcely a hope of its being out in June. Henry does not neglect\\nit; he has hurried the printer, and says he will see him again to-day.\\nIt will not stand still during his absence, it will be sent to Eliza.\\n\\nThe Incomes remain as they were, but I will get them altered if I can. I\\nam very much gratified by Mrs. K.\\'s interest in it; and whatever may be\\nthe event of it as to my credit with her, sincerely wish her curiosity\\ncould be satisfied sooner than is now probable. I think she will like my\\nElinor, but cannot build on anything else.\\n\\nOur party went off extremely well. There were many solicitudes, alarms,\\nand vexations beforehand, of course, but at last everything was quite\\nright. The rooms were dressed up with flowers, etc., and looked very\\npretty. A glass for the mantelpiece was lent by the man who is making\\ntheir own. Mr. Egerton and Mr. Walter came at half-past five, and the\\nfestivities began with a pair of very fine soles.\\n\\nYes, Mr. Walter--for he postponed his leaving London on purpose--which\\ndid not give much pleasure at the time, any more than the circumstance\\nfrom which it rose,--his calling on Sunday and being asked by Henry to\\ntake the family dinner on that day, which he did; but it is all smoothed\\nover now, and she likes him very well.\\n\\nAt half-past seven arrived the musicians in two hackney coaches, and by\\neight the lordly company began to appear. Among the earliest were George\\nand Mary Cooke, and I spent the greatest part of the evening very\\npleasantly with them. The drawing-room being soon hotter than we liked,\\nwe placed ourselves in the connecting passage, which was comparatively\\ncool, and gave us all the advantage of the music at a pleasant distance,\\nas well as that of the first view of every new-comer.\\n\\nI was quite surrounded by acquaintance, especially gentlemen; and what\\nwith Mr. Hampson, Mr. Seymour, Mr. W. Knatchbull, Mr. Guillemarde, Mr.\\nCure, a Captain Simpson, brother to _the_ Captain Simpson, besides Mr.\\nWalter and Mr. Egerton, in addition to the Cookes, and Miss Beckford,\\nand Miss Middleton, I had quite as much upon my hands as I could do.\\n\\nPoor Miss B. has been suffering again from her old complaint, and looks\\nthinner than ever. She certainly goes to Cheltenham the beginning of\\nJune. We were all delight and cordiality, of course. Miss M. seems very\\nhappy, but has not beauty enough to figure in London.\\n\\nIncluding everybody we were sixty-six,--which was considerably more than\\nEliza had expected, and quite enough to fill the back drawing-room and\\nleave a few to be scattered about in the other and in the passage.\\n\\nThe music was extremely good. It opened (tell Fanny) with \"Poike de Parp\\npirs praise pof Prapela;\" and of the other glees I remember, \"In peace\\nlove tunes,\" \"Rosabelle,\" \"The Red Cross Knight,\" and \"Poor Insect.\"\\nBetween the songs were lessons on the harp, or harp and pianoforte\\ntogether; and the harp-player was Wiepart, whose name seems famous,\\nthough new to me. There was one female singer, a short Miss Davis, all\\nin blue, bringing up for the public line, whose voice was said to be\\nvery fine indeed; and all the performers gave great satisfaction by\\ndoing what they were paid for, and giving themselves no airs. No amateur\\ncould be persuaded to do anything.\\n\\nThe house was not clear till after twelve. If you wish to hear more of\\nit, you must put your questions, but I seem rather to have exhausted\\nthan spared the subject.\\n\\nThis said Captain Simpson told us, on the authority of some other\\nCaptain just arrived from Halifax, that Charles was bringing the\\n\"Cleopatra\" home, and that she was probably by this time in the\\nChannel; but as Captain S. was certainly in liquor, we must not quite\\ndepend on it. It must give one a sort of expectation, however, and will\\nprevent my writing to him any more. I would rather he should not reach\\nEngland till I am at home, and the Steventon party gone.\\n\\nMy mother and Martha both write with great satisfaction of Anna\\'s\\nbehavior. She is quite an Anna with variations, but she cannot have\\nreached her last, for that is always the most flourishing and showy; she\\nis at about her third or fourth, which are generally simple and pretty.\\n\\nYour lilacs are in leaf, ours are in bloom. The horse-chestnuts are\\nquite out, and the elms almost. I had a pleasant walk in Kensington\\nGardens on Sunday with Henry, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Tilson; everything was\\nfresh and beautiful.\\n\\nWe did go to the play, after all, on Saturday. We went to the Lyceum,\\nand saw the \"Hypocrite,\" an old play taken from Molière\\'s \"Tartuffe,\"\\nand were well entertained. Dowton and Mathews were the good actors; Mrs.\\nEdwin was the heroine, and her performance is just what it used to be. I\\nhave no chance of seeing Mrs. Siddons; she did act on Monday, but as\\nHenry was told by the box-keeper that he did not think she would, the\\nplans, and all thought of it, were given up. I should particularly have\\nliked seeing her in \"Constance,\" and could swear at her with little\\neffort for disappointing me.\\n\\nHenry has been to the Water-Color Exhibition, which opened on Monday,\\nand is to meet us there again some morning. If Eliza cannot go (and she\\nhas a cold at present), Miss Beaty will be invited to be my companion.\\nHenry leaves town on Sunday afternoon, but he means to write soon\\nhimself to Edward, and will tell his own plans.\\n\\nThe tea is this moment setting out.\\n\\nDo not have your colored muslin unless you really want it, because I am\\nafraid I could not send it to the coach without giving trouble here.\\n\\nEliza caught her cold on Sunday in our way to the D\\'Entraigues. The\\nhorses actually gibbed on this side of Hyde Park Gate: a load of fresh\\ngravel made it a formidable hill to them, and they refused the collar; I\\nbelieve there was a sore shoulder to irritate. Eliza was frightened, and\\nwe got out, and were detained in the evening air several minutes. The\\ncold is in her chest, but she takes care of herself, and I hope it may\\nnot last long.\\n\\nThis engagement prevented Mr. Walter\\'s staying late,--he had his coffee\\nand went away. Eliza enjoyed her evening very much, and means to\\ncultivate the acquaintance; and I see nothing to dislike in them but\\ntheir taking quantities of snuff. Monsieur, the old Count, is a very\\nfine-looking man, with quiet manners, good enough for an Englishman,\\nand, I believe, is a man of great information and taste. He has some\\nfine paintings, which delighted Henry as much as the son\\'s music\\ngratified Eliza; and among them a miniature of Philip V. of Spain, Louis\\nXIV.\\'s grandson, which exactly suited my capacity. Count Julien\\'s\\nperformance is very wonderful.\\n\\nWe met only Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, and we are just now engaged to\\nspend next Sunday evening at Mrs. L.\\'s, and to meet the D\\'Entraigues,\\nbut M. le Comte must do without Henry. If he would but speak English, I\\nwould take to him.\\n\\nHave you ever mentioned the leaving off tea to Mrs. K.? Eliza has just\\nspoken of it again. The benefit she has found from it in sleeping has\\nbeen very great.\\n\\nI shall write soon to Catherine to fix my day, which will be Thursday.\\nWe have no engagement but for Sunday. Eliza\\'s cold makes quiet\\nadvisable. Her party is mentioned in this morning\\'s paper. I am sorry to\\nhear of poor Fanny\\'s state. From that quarter, I suppose, is to be the\\nalloy of her happiness. I will have no more to say.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\n                                                     J.

I depended upon hearing something of the evening from\\nMr. W.

I should like to know\\nwhat her estimate is, but am always half afraid of finding a clever\\nnovel too clever, and of finding my own story and my own people all\\nforestalled.\\n\\nEliza has just received a few lines from Henry to assure her of the good\\nconduct of his mare. He slept at Uxbridge on Sunday, and wrote from\\nWheatfield.\\n\\nWe were not claimed by Hans Place yesterday, but are to dine there\\nto-day. Mr. Tilson called in the evening, but otherwise we were quite\\nalone all day; and after having been out a good deal, the change was\\nvery pleasant.\\n\\nI like your opinion of Miss Atten much better than I expected, and have\\nnow hopes of her staying a whole twelvemonth. By this time I suppose she\\nis hard at it, governing away. Poor creature!

I am afraid I shall not\\nhave any for you.\\n\\nI forgot to tell you in my last that our cousin Miss Payne called in on\\nSaturday, and was persuaded to stay dinner.

I had forgot there were but eight already.\\n\\nYour inquiry after my uncle and aunt were most happily timed, for the\\nvery same post brought an account of them. They are again at Gloucester\\nHouse enjoying fresh air, which they seem to have felt the want of in\\nBath, and are tolerably well, but not more than tolerable. My aunt does\\nnot enter into particulars, but she does not write in spirits, and we\\nimagine that she has never entirely got the better of her disorder in\\nthe winter. Mrs. Welby takes her out airing in her barouche, which gives\\nher a headache,--a comfortable proof, I suppose, of the uselessness of\\nthe new carriage when they have got it.\\n\\nYou certainly must have heard before I can tell you that Col. Orde has\\nmarried our cousin Margt. Beckford, the Marchess. of Douglas's sister.\\nThe papers say that her father disinherits her, but I think too well of\\nan Orde to suppose that she has not a handsome independence of her own.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Chawton Cottage, from the Garden_\\n\\nLETTERS, 172]\\n\\nThe chickens are all alive and fit for the table, but we save them for\\nsomething grand. Some of the flower seeds are coming up very well, but\\nyour mignonette makes a wretched appearance. Miss Benn has been\\nequally unlucky as to hers. She had seed from four different people, and\\nnone of it comes up. Our young piony at the foot of the fir-tree has\\njust blown and looks very handsome, and the whole of the shrubbery\\nborder will soon be very gay with pinks and sweet-williams, in addition\\nto the columbines already in bloom. The syringas, too, are coming out.\\nWe are likely to have a great crop of Orleans plums, but not many\\ngreengages--on the standard scarcely any, three or four dozen, perhaps,\\nagainst the wall. I believe I told you differently when I first came\\nhome, but I can now judge better than I could then.\\n\\nI have had a medley and satisfactory letter this morning from the\\nhusband and wife at Cowes; and in consequence of what is related of\\ntheir plans, we have been talking over the possibility of inviting them\\nhere in their way from Steventon, which is what one should wish to do,\\nand is, I dare say, what they expect, but, supposing Martha to be at\\nhome, it does not seem a very easy thing to accommodate so large a\\nparty. My mother offers to give up her room to Frank and Mary, but there\\nwill then be only the best for two maids and three children.\\n\\nThey go to Steventon about the 22d, and I guess--for it is quite a\\nguess--will stay there from a fortnight to three weeks.\\n\\nI must not venture to press Miss Sharpe's coming at present; we may\\nhardly be at liberty before August.\\n\\nPoor John Bridges! we are very sorry for his situation and for the\\ndistress of the family. Lady B., is in one way severely tried. And our\\nown dear brother suffers a great deal, I dare say, on the occasion.\\n\\nI have not much to say of ourselves. Anna is nursing a cold caught in\\nthe arbor at Faringdon, that she may be able to keep her engagement to\\nMaria M. this evening, when I suppose she will make it worse.\\n\\nShe did not return from Faringdon till Sunday, when H. B. walked home\\nwith her, and drank tea here. She was with the Prowtings almost all\\nMonday. She went to learn to make feather trimmings of Miss Anna, and\\nthey kept her to dinner, which was rather lucky, as we were called upon\\nto meet Mrs. and Miss Terry the same evening at the Digweeds; and though\\nAnna was of course invited too, I think it always safest to keep her\\naway from the family, lest she should be doing too little or too much.\\n\\nMrs. Terry, Mary, and Robert, with my aunt Harding and her daughter,\\ncame from Dummer for a day and a night,--all very agreeable and very\\nmuch delighted with the new house and with Chawton in general.\\n\\nWe sat upstairs, and had thunder and lightning as usual. I never knew\\nsuch a spring for thunderstorms as it has been. Thank God! we have had\\nno bad ones here. I thought myself in luck to have my uncomfortable\\nfeelings shared by the mistress of the house, as that procured blinds\\nand candles. It had been excessively hot the whole day. Mrs. Harding is\\na good-looking woman, but not much like Mrs. Toke, inasmuch as she is\\nvery brown and has scarcely any teeth; she seems to have some of Mrs.\\nToke's civility. Miss H. is an elegant, pleasing, pretty-looking girl,\\nabout nineteen, I suppose, or nineteen and a half, or nineteen and a\\nquarter, with flowers in her head and music at her finger-ends. She\\nplays very well indeed. I have seldom heard anybody with more pleasure.\\nThey were at Godington four or five years ago. My cousin Flora Long was\\nthere last year.\\n\\nMy name is Diana. How does Fanny like it? What a change in the weather!\\nWe have a fire again now.\\n\\nHarriet Benn sleeps at the Great House to-night, and spends to-morrow\\nwith us; and the plan is that we should all walk with her to drink tea\\nat Faringdon, for her mother is now recovered; but the state of the\\nweather is not very promising at present.\\n\\nMiss Benn has been returned to her cottage since the beginning of last\\nweek, and has now just got another girl; she comes from Alton. For many\\ndays Miss B. had nobody with her but her niece Elizabeth, who was\\ndelighted to be her visitor and her maid.

I was\\nrather disappointed, I confess, to find that she could not leave town\\ntill after ye 24th, as I had hoped to see you here the week before. The\\ndelay, however, is not great, and everything seems generally arranging\\nitself for your return very comfortably.\\n\\nI found Henry perfectly predisposed to bring you to London if agreeable\\nto yourself; he has not fixed his day for going into Kent, but he must\\nbe back again before ye 20th. You may therefore think with something\\nlike certainty of the close of your Godmersham visit, and will have, I\\nsuppose, about a week for Sloane Street. He travels in his gig, and\\nshould the weather be tolerable I think you must have a delightful\\njourney.\\n\\nI have given up all idea of Miss Sharpe\\'s travelling with you and\\nMartha, for though you are both all compliance with my scheme, yet as\\nyou knock off a week from the end of her visit, and Martha rather more\\nfrom the beginning, the thing is out of the question.\\n\\nI have written to her to say that after the middle of July we shall be\\nhappy to receive her, and I have added a welcome if she could make her\\nway hither directly, but I do not expect that she will. I have also sent\\nour invitation to Cowes.\\n\\nWe are very sorry for the disappointment you have all had in Lady B.\\'s\\nillness; but a division of the proposed party is with you by this time,\\nand I hope may have brought you a better account of the rest.\\n\\nGive my love and thanks to Harriot, who has written me charming things\\nof your looks, and diverted me very much by poor Mrs. C. Milles\\'s\\ncontinued perplexity.\\n\\nI had a few lines from Henry on Tuesday to prepare us for himself and\\nhis friend, and by the time that I had made the sumptuous provision of a\\nneck of mutton on the occasion, they drove into the court; but lest you\\nshould not immediately recollect in how many hours a neck of mutton may\\nbe certainly procured, I add that they came a little after twelve,--both\\ntall and well, and in their different degrees agreeable.\\n\\nIt was a visit of only twenty-four hours, but very pleasant while it\\nlasted. Mr. Tilson took a sketch of the Great House before dinner, and\\nafter dinner we all three walked to Chawton Park,[14] meaning to go into\\nit, but it was too dirty, and we were obliged to keep on the outside.\\nMr. Tilson admired the trees very much, but grieved that they should not\\nbe turned into money.\\n\\nMy mother\\'s cold is better, and I believe she only wants dry weather to\\nbe very well. It was a great distress to her that Anna should be absent\\nduring her uncle\\'s visit, a distress which I could not share. She does\\nnot return from Faringdon till this evening, and I doubt not has had\\nplenty of the miscellaneous, unsettled sort of happiness which seems to\\nsuit her best. We hear from Miss Benn, who was on the Common with the\\nProwtings, that she was very much admired by the gentlemen in general.\\n\\nI like your new bonnets exceedingly; yours is a shape which always looks\\nwell, and I think Fanny\\'s particularly becoming to her.\\n\\nOn Monday I had the pleasure of receiving, unpacking, and approving our\\nWedgwood ware. It all came very safely, and upon the whole is a good\\nmatch, though I think they might have allowed us rather larger leaves,\\nespecially in such a year of fine foliage as this. One is apt to suppose\\nthat the woods about Birmingham must be blighted. There was no bill with\\nthe goods, but that shall not screen them from being paid. I mean to ask\\nMartha to settle the account. It will be quite in her way, for she is\\njust now sending my mother a breakfast-set from the same place.\\n\\nI hope it will come by the wagon to-morrow; it is certainly what we\\nwant, and I long to know what it is like, and as I am sure Martha has\\ngreat pleasure in making the present, I will not have any regret. We\\nhave considerable dealings with the wagons at present: a hamper of port\\nand brandy from Southampton is now in the kitchen.\\n\\nYour answer about the Miss Plumbtrees proves you as fine a Daniel as\\never Portia was; for I maintained Emma to be the eldest.\\n\\nWe began pease on Sunday, but our gatherings are very small, not at all\\nlike the gathering in the \"Lady of the Lake.\" Yesterday I had the\\nagreeable surprise of finding several scarlet strawberries quite ripe;\\nhad you been at home, this would have been a pleasure lost. There are\\nmore gooseberries and fewer currants than I thought at first. We must\\nbuy currants for our wine.\\n\\nThe Digweeds are gone down to see the Stephen Terrys at Southampton, and\\ncatch the King\\'s birthday at Portsmouth. Miss Papillon called on us\\nyesterday, looking handsomer than ever. Maria Middleton and Miss Benn\\ndine here to-morrow.\\n\\nWe are not to enclose any more letters to Abingdon Street, as perhaps\\nMartha has told you.\\n\\nI had just left off writing and put on my things for walking to Alton,\\nwhen Anna and her friend Harriot called in their way thither; so we went\\ntogether. Their business was to provide mourning against the King\\'s\\ndeath, and my mother has had a bombazine bought for her. I am not sorry\\nto be back again, for the young ladies had a great deal to do, and\\nwithout much method in doing it.\\n\\nAnna does not come home till to-morrow morning. She has written I find\\nto Fanny, but there does not seem to be a great deal to relate of\\nTuesday. I had hoped there might be dancing.\\n\\nMrs. Budd died on Sunday evening. I saw her two days before her death,\\nand thought it must happen soon. She suffered much from weakness and\\nrestlessness almost to the last. Poor little Harriot seems truly\\ngrieved. You have never mentioned Harry; how is he?\\n\\nWith love to you all,\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,      J.

Miss B. dined with us on the very day of the\\nbook\\'s coming, and in the evening we fairly set at it, and read half the\\nfirst vol. to her, prefacing that, having intelligence from Henry that\\nsuch a work would soon appear, we had desired him to send it whenever it\\ncame out, and I believe it passed with her unsuspected. She was amused,\\npoor soul! _That_ she could not help, you know, with two such people to\\nlead the way; but she really does seem to admire Elizabeth. I must\\nconfess that I think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in\\nprint, and how I shall be able to tolerate those who do not like _her_\\nat least, I do not know. There are a few typical errors; and a \"said\\nhe,\" or a \"said she,\" would sometimes make the dialogue more immediately\\nclear; but \"I do not write for such dull elves\" as have not a great deal\\nof ingenuity themselves. The second volume is shorter than I could wish,\\nbut the difference is not so much in reality as in look, there being a\\nlarger proportion of narrative in that part. I have lop\\'t and crop\\'t so\\nsuccessfully, however, that I imagine it must be rather shorter than\\n\"Sense and Sensibility\" altogether.

Our second evening's reading to Miss B. had not\\npleased me so well, but I believe something must be attributed to my\\nmother's too rapid way of getting on: though she perfectly understands\\nthe characters herself, she cannot speak as they ought. Upon the whole,\\nhowever, I am quite vain enough and well satisfied enough. The work is\\nrather too light and bright and sparkling: it wants shade; it wants to\\nbe stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense, if it\\ncould be had; if not, of solemn specious nonsense, about something\\nunconnected with the story,--an essay on writing, a critique on Walter\\nScott, or the history of Buonaparte, or something that would form a\\ncontrast, and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness\\nand epigrammatism of the general style. . . . The greatest blunder in\\nthe printing that I have met with is in page 220, v. 3, where two\\nspeeches are made into one.

I doubt its\\nhaving much else to recommend it; but there is no saying: it may turn\\nout to be a very long and delightful letter. I am exceedingly pleased\\nthat you can say what you do, after having gone through the whole work,\\nand Fanny\\'s praise is very gratifying. My hopes were tolerably strong of\\nher, but nothing like a certainty. Her liking Darcy and Elizabeth is\\nenough. She might hate all the others, if she would. I have her opinion\\nunder her own hand this morning; but your transcript of it, which I read\\nfirst, was not, and is not, the less acceptable. To me it is of course\\nall praise, but the more exact truth which she sends you is good\\nenough. . . . Our party on Wednesday was not unagreeable, though we\\nwanted a master of the house less anxious and fidgety, and more\\nconversable. Upon Mrs. ----\\'s mentioning that she had sent the rejected\\naddresses to Mrs. H., I began talking to her a little about them, and\\nexpressed my hope of their having amused her. Her answer was, \"Oh dear,\\nyes, very much, very droll indeed, the opening of the house, and the\\nstriking up of the fiddles!\" What she meant, poor woman, who shall say?\\nI sought no farther. As soon as a whist-party was formed, and a round\\ntable threatened, I made my mother an excuse and came away, leaving just\\nas many for their round table as there were at Mrs. Grant\\'s.[16] I wish\\nthey might be as agreeable a set. My mother is very well, and finds\\ngreat amusement in glove-knitting, and at present wants no other work.\\nWe quite run over with books. She has got Sir John Carr\\'s \"Travels in\\nSpain,\" and I am reading a Society octavo, an \"Essay on the Military\\nPolice and Institutions of the British Empire,\" by Capt. Pasley of the\\nEngineers,--a book which I protested against at first, but which upon\\ntrial I find delightfully written and highly entertaining. I am as much\\nin love with the author as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even\\nthe two Mr. Smiths of the city. The first soldier I ever sighed for; but\\nhe does write with extraordinary force and spirit. Yesterday, moreover,\\nbrought us \"Mrs. Grant\\'s Letters,\" with Mr. White\\'s compliments; but I\\nhave disposed of them, compliments and all, to Miss P., and amongst so\\nmany readers or retainers of books as we have in Chawton, I dare say\\nthere will be no difficulty in getting rid of them for another\\nfortnight, if necessary. I have disposed of Mrs. Grant for the second\\nfortnight to Mrs. ----. It can make no difference to her which of the\\ntwenty-six fortnights in the year the three vols. lie on her table. I\\nhave been applied to for information as to the oath taken in former\\ntimes of Bell, Book, and Candle, but have none to give. Perhaps you may\\nbe able to learn something of its origin where you now are. Ladies who\\nread those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always\\nsees in the breakfast-parlor there must be acquainted with everything\\nin the world. I detest a quarto. Captain Pasley\\'s book is too good for\\ntheir society. They will not understand a man who condenses his thoughts\\ninto an octavo. I have learned from Sir J. Carr that there is no\\nGovernment House at Gibraltar.

I cannot say that I have yet been in any\\ndistress for money, but I choose to have my due, as well as the Devil.\\nHow lucky we were in our weather yesterday! This wet morning makes one\\nmore sensible of it. We had no rain of any consequence. The head of the\\ncurricle was put half up three or four times, but our share of the\\nshowers was very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy all round us,\\nwhen we were on the Hog\\'s-back, and I fancied it might then be raining\\nso hard at Chawton as to make you feel for us much more than we\\ndeserved. Three hours and a quarter took us to Guildford, where we\\nstayed barely two hours, and had only just time enough for all we had\\nto do there; that is, eating a long and comfortable breakfast, watching\\nthe carriages, paying Mr. Harrington, and taking a little stroll\\nafterwards. From some views which that stroll gave us, I think most\\nhighly of the situation of Guildford. We wanted all our brothers and\\nsisters to be standing with us in the bowling-green, and looking towards\\nHorsham. I was very lucky in my gloves,--got them at the first shop I\\nwent to, though I went into it rather because it was near than because\\nit looked at all like a glove-shop, and gave only four shillings for\\nthem; after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting\\nthat they cannot be good for anything, and their worth certainly remains\\nto be proved; but I think they look very well. We left Guildford at\\ntwenty minutes before twelve (I hope somebody cares for these minutiæ),\\nand were at Esher in about two hours more. I was very much pleased with\\nthe country in general. Between Guildford and Ripley I thought it\\nparticularly pretty, also about Painshill; and from a Mr. Spicer\\'s\\ngrounds at Esher, which we walked into before dinner, the views were\\nbeautiful. I cannot say what we did _not_ see, but I should think there\\ncould not be a wood, or a meadow, or palace, or remarkable spot in\\nEngland that was not spread out before us on one side or other.\\nClaremont is going to be sold: a Mr. Ellis has it now. It is a house\\nthat seems never to have prospered. After dinner we walked forward to be\\novertaken at the coachman\\'s time, and before he did overtake us we were\\nvery near Kingston. I fancy it was about half-past six when we reached\\nthis house,--a twelve hours\\' business, and the horses did not appear\\nmore than reasonably tired. I was very tired too, and glad to get to bed\\nearly, but am quite well to-day. I am very snug in the front\\ndrawing-room all to myself, and would not say \"thank you\" for any\\ncompany but you. The quietness of it does me good. I have contrived to\\npay my two visits, though the weather made me a great while about it,\\nand left me only a few minutes to sit with Charlotte Craven.[17] She\\nlooks very well, and her hair is done up with an elegance to do credit\\nto any education. Her manners are as unaffected and pleasing as ever.\\nShe had heard from her mother to-day. Mrs. Craven spends another\\nfortnight at Chilton. I saw nobody but Charlotte, which pleased me best.\\nI was shown upstairs into a drawing-room, where she came to me; and the\\nappearance of the room, so totally unschoollike, amused me very much: it\\nwas full of modern elegances.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affec^{tly},\\n                                                      J.

       " '                                      SLOANE STREET, Monday (May 24).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I am very much obliged to you for writing to me.\\nYou must have hated it after a worrying morning. Your letter came just\\nin time to save my going to Remnant\\'s, and fit me for Christian\\'s, where\\nI bought Fanny\\'s dimity.\\n\\nI went the day before (Friday) to Layton\\'s as I proposed, and got my\\nmother\\'s gown,--seven yards at 6_s._ 6_d._ I then walked into No. 10,\\nwhich is all dirt and confusion, but in a very promising way; and after\\nbeing present at the opening of a new account, to my great amusement,\\nHenry and I went to the exhibition in Spring Gardens. It is not thought\\na good collection, but I was very well pleased, particularly (pray tell\\nFanny) with a small portrait of Mrs. Bingley,[1] excessively like her.\\n\\nI went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there was no Mrs.\\nDarcy.[18] Perhaps, however, I may find her in the great exhibition,\\nwhich we shall go to if we have time. I have no chance of her in the\\ncollection of Sir Joshua Reynolds\\'s paintings, which is now showing in\\nPall Mall, and which we are also to visit.\\n\\nMrs. Bingley\\'s is exactly herself,--size, shaped face, features, and\\nsweetness; there never was a greater likeness. She is dressed in a white\\ngown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\\nsupposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I dare say Mrs. D.\\nwill be in yellow.\\n\\nFriday was our worst day as to weather. We were out in a very long and\\nvery heavy storm of hail, and there had been others before, but I heard\\nno thunder. Saturday was a good deal better; dry and cold.\\n\\nI gave 2_s._ 6_d._ for the dimity. I do not boast of any bargains, but\\nthink both the sarsenet and dimity good of their sort.\\n\\nI have bought your locket, but was obliged to give 18_s._ for it, which\\nmust be rather more than you intended. It is neat and plain, set in\\ngold.\\n\\nWe were to have gone to the Somerset House Exhibition on Saturday, but\\nwhen I reached Henrietta Street Mr. Hampson was wanted there, and Mr.\\nTilson and I were obliged to drive about town after him, and by the time\\nwe had done it was too late for anything but home. We never found him\\nafter all.\\n\\nI have been interrupted by Mrs. Tilson. Poor woman! She is in danger of\\nnot being able to attend Lady Drummond Smith\\'s party to-night. Miss\\nBurdett was to have taken her, and now Miss Burdett has a cough and\\nwill not go. My cousin Caroline is her sole dependence.\\n\\nThe events of yesterday were, our going to Belgrave Chapel in the\\nmorning, our being prevented by the rain from going to evening service\\nat St. James, Mr. Hampson\\'s calling, Messrs. Barlow and Phillips dining\\nhere, and Mr. and Mrs. Tilson\\'s coming in the evening _à l\\'ordinaire_.\\nShe drank tea with us both Thursday and Saturday; he dined out each day,\\nand on Friday we were with them, and they wish us to go to them\\nto-morrow evening, to meet Miss Burdett, but I do not know how it will\\nend. Henry talks of a drive to Hampstead, which may interfere with it.\\n\\nI should like to see Miss Burdett very well, but that I am rather\\nfrightened by hearing that she wishes to be introduced to me. If I am a\\nwild beast, I cannot help it. It is not my own fault.\\n\\nThere is no change in our plan of leaving London, but we shall not be\\nwith you before Tuesday. Henry thinks Monday would appear too early a\\nday. There is no danger of our being induced to stay longer.\\n\\nI have not quite determined how I shall manage about my clothes; perhaps\\nthere may be only my trunk to send by the coach, or there may be a\\nband-box with it. I have taken your gentle hint, and written to Mrs.\\nHill.\\n\\nThe Hoblyns want us to dine with them, but we have refused. When Henry\\nreturns he will be dining out a great deal, I dare say; as he will then\\nbe alone, it will be more desirable; he will be more welcome at every\\ntable, and every invitation more welcome to him. He will not want either\\nof us again till he is settled in Henrietta Street. This is my present\\npersuasion. And he will not be settled there--really settled--till late\\nin the autumn; \"he will not be come to bide\" till after September.\\n\\nThere is a gentleman in treaty for this house. Gentleman himself is in\\nthe country, but gentleman\\'s friend came to see it the other day, and\\nseemed pleased on the whole. Gentleman would rather prefer an increased\\nrent to parting with five hundred guineas at once, and if that is the\\nonly difficulty it will not be minded. Henry is indifferent as to the\\nwhich.\\n\\nGet us the best weather you can for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We\\nare to go to Windsor in our way to Henley, which will be a great\\ndelight. We shall be leaving Sloane Street about twelve, two or three\\nhours after Charles\\'s party have begun their journey. You will miss\\nthem, but the comfort of getting back into your own room will be great.\\nAnd then the tea and sugar!\\n\\nI fear Miss Clewes is not better, or you would have mentioned it. I\\nshall not write again unless I have any unexpected communication or\\nopportunity to tempt me. I enclose Mr. Herington\\'s bill and receipt.\\n\\nI am very much obliged to Fanny for her letter; it made me laugh\\nheartily, but I cannot pretend to answer it. Even had I more time, I\\nshould not feel at all sure of the sort of letter that Miss D.[19] would\\nwrite. I hope Miss Benn is got well again, and will have a comfortable\\ndinner with you to-day.\\n\\n_Monday Evening._--We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\\nReynolds\\'s, and I am disappointed, for there was nothing like Mrs. D. at\\neither. I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too\\nmuch to like it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine he\\nwould have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of love, pride, and\\ndelicacy.\\n\\nSetting aside this disappointment, I had great amusement among the\\npictures; and the driving about, the carriage being open, was very\\npleasant. I liked my solitary elegance very much, and was ready to laugh\\nall the time at my being where I was. I could not but feel that I had\\nnaturally small right to be parading about London in a barouche.\\n\\nHenry desires Edward may know that he has just bought three dozen of\\nclaret for him (cheap), and ordered it to be sent down to Chawton.\\n\\nI should not wonder if we got no farther than Reading on Thursday\\nevening, and so reach Steventon only to a reasonable dinner-hour the\\nnext day; but whatever I may write or you may imagine, we know it will\\nbe something different. I shall be quiet to-morrow morning; all my\\nbusiness is done, and I shall only call again upon Mrs. Hoblyn, etc.\\n\\nLove to your much . . . party.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\n                                                     J.

       " '                         HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (Sept. 15, ½ past 8).\\n\\nHERE I am, my dearest Cassandra, seated in the breakfast, dining,\\nsitting room, beginning with all my might. Fanny will join me as soon as\\nshe is dressed, and begin her letter.\\n\\nWe had a very good journey, weather and roads excellent; the three first\\nstages for 1_s._ 6_d._, and our only misadventure the being delayed\\nabout a quarter of an hour at Kingston for horses, and being obliged to\\nput up with a pair belonging to a hackney coach and their coachman,\\nwhich left no room on the barouche box for Lizzy, who was to have gone\\nher last stage there as she did the first; consequently we were all\\nfour within, which was a little crowded.\\n\\nWe arrived at a quarter-past four, and were kindly welcomed by the\\ncoachman, and then by his master, and then by William, and then by Mrs.\\nPengird, who all met us before we reached the foot of the stairs. Mde.\\nBigion was below dressing us a most comfortable dinner of soup, fish,\\nbouillée, partridges, and an apple tart, which we sat down to soon after\\nfive, after cleaning and dressing ourselves, and feeling that we were\\nmost commodiously disposed of. The little adjoining dressing-room to our\\napartment makes Fanny and myself very well off indeed, and as we have\\npoor Eliza\\'s[20] bed our space is ample every way.\\n\\nSace arrived safely about half-past six. At seven we set off in a coach\\nfor the Lyceum; were at home again in about four hours and a half; had\\nsoup and wine and water, and then went to our holes.\\n\\nEdward finds his quarters very snug and quiet. I must get a softer pen.\\nThis is harder. I am in agonies. I have not yet seen Mr. Crabbe.\\nMartha\\'s letter is gone to the post.\\n\\nI am going to write nothing but short sentences. There shall be two full\\nstops in every line. Layton and Shear\\'s is Bedford House. We mean to\\nget there before breakfast if it\\'s possible; for we feel more and more\\nhow much we have to do and how little time. This house looks very nice.\\nIt seems like Sloane Street moved here. I believe Henry is just rid of\\nSloane Street. Fanny does not come, but I have Edward seated by me\\nbeginning a letter, which looks natural.\\n\\nHenry has been suffering from the pain in the face which he has been\\nsubject to before. He caught cold at Matlock, and since his return has\\nbeen paying a little for past pleasure. It is nearly removed now, but he\\nlooks thin in the face, either from the pain or the fatigues of his\\ntour, which must have been great.\\n\\nLady Robert is delighted with P. and P.,[21] and really was so, as I\\nunderstand, before she knew who wrote it, for of course she knows now.\\nHe told her with as much satisfaction as if it were my wish. He did not\\ntell me this, but he told Fanny. And Mr. Hastings! I am quite delighted\\nwith what such a man writes about it. Henry sent him the books after his\\nreturn from Daylesford, but you will hear the letter too.\\n\\nLet me be rational, and return to my two full stops.\\n\\nI talked to Henry at the play last night. We were in a private box,--Mr.\\nSpencer\\'s,--which made it much more pleasant. The box is directly on\\nthe stage. One is infinitely less fatigued than in the common way. But\\nHenry\\'s plans are not what one could wish. He does not mean to be at\\nChawton till the 29th. He must be in town again by Oct. 5. His plan is\\nto get a couple of days of pheasant shooting and then return directly.\\nHis wish was to bring you back with him. I have told him your scruples.\\nHe wishes you to suit yourself as to time, and if you cannot come till\\nlater, will send for you at any time as far as Bagshot. He presumed you\\nwould not find difficulty in getting so far. I could not say you would.\\nHe proposed your going with him into Oxfordshire. It was his own thought\\nat first. I could not but catch at it for you.\\n\\nWe have talked of it again this morning (for now we have breakfasted),\\nand I am convinced that if you can make it suit in other respects you\\nneed not scruple on his account. If you cannot come back with him on the\\n3rd or 4th, therefore, I do hope you will contrive to go to Adlestrop.\\nBy not beginning your absence till about the middle of this month I\\nthink you may manage it very well. But you will think all this over. One\\ncould wish he had intended to come to you earlier, but it cannot be\\nhelped.\\n\\nI said nothing to him of Mrs. H. and Miss B., that he might not suppose\\ndifficulties. Shall not you put them into our own room? This seems to\\nme the best plan, and the maid will be most conveniently near.\\n\\nOh, dear me! when I shall ever have done. We did go to Layton and\\nShear\\'s before breakfast. Very pretty English poplins at 4_s._ 3_d._;\\nIrish, ditto at 6_s._; more pretty, certainly,--beautiful.\\n\\nFanny and the two little girls are gone to take places for to-night at\\nCovent Garden; \"Clandestine Marriage\" and \"Midas.\" The latter will be a\\nfine show for L. and M.[22] They revelled last night in \"Don Juan,\" whom\\nwe left in hell at half-past eleven. We had scaramouch and a ghost, and\\nwere delighted. I speak of them; my delight was very tranquil, and the\\nrest of us were sober-minded. \"Don Juan\" was the last of three musical\\nthings. \"Five Hours at Brighton,\" in three acts,--of which one was over\\nbefore we arrived, none the worse,--and the \"Beehive,\" rather less flat\\nand trumpery.\\n\\nI have this moment received 5_l._ from kind, beautiful Edward. Fanny has\\na similar gift. I shall save what I can of it for your better leisure in\\nthis place. My letter was from Miss Sharpe,--nothing particular. A\\nletter from Fanny Cage this morning.\\n\\n_Four o\\'clock._--We are just come back from doing Mrs. Tickars, Miss\\nHare, and Mr. Spence. Mr. Hall is here, and while Fanny is under his\\nhands, I will try to write a little more.\\n\\nMiss Hare had some pretty caps, and is to make me one like one of them,\\nonly white satin instead of blue. It will be white satin and lace, and a\\nlittle white flower perking out of the left ear, like Harriot Byron\\'s\\nfeather. I have allowed her to go as far as 1_l._ 16_s._ My gown is to\\nbe trimmed everywhere with white ribbon plaited on somehow or other. She\\nsays it will look well. I am not sanguine. They trim with white very\\nmuch.\\n\\nI learnt from Mrs. Tickars\\'s young lady, to my high amusement, that the\\nstays now are not made to force the bosom up at all; that was a very\\nunbecoming, unnatural fashion. I was really glad to hear that they are\\nnot to be so much off the shoulders as they were.\\n\\nGoing to Mr. Spence\\'s was a sad business, and cost us many tears;\\nunluckily we were obliged to go a second time before he could do more\\nthan just look. We went first at half-past twelve and afterwards at\\nthree; papa with us each time; and, alas! we are to go again to-morrow.\\nLizzy is not finished yet. There have been no teeth taken out, however,\\nnor will be, I believe; but he finds hers in a very bad state, and seems\\nto think particularly ill of their durableness. They have been all\\ncleaned, hers filed, and are to be filed again. There is a very sad hole\\nbetween two of her front teeth.\\n\\n_Thursday Morning, half-past Seven._--Up and dressed and downstairs in\\norder to finish my letter in time for the parcel. At eight I have an\\nappointment with Madame B., who wants to show me something downstairs.\\nAt nine we are to set off for Grafton House, and get that over before\\nbreakfast. Edward is so kind as to walk there with us. We are to be at\\nMr. Spence\\'s again at 11.5: from that time shall be driving about I\\nsuppose till four o\\'clock at least. We are, if possible, to call on Mrs.\\nTilson.\\n\\nMr. Hall was very punctual yesterday, and curled me out at a great rate.\\nI thought it looked hideous, and longed for a snug cap instead, but my\\ncompanions silenced me by their admiration. I had only a bit of velvet\\nround my head. I did not catch cold, however. The weather is all in my\\nfavor. I have had no pain in my face since I left you.\\n\\nWe had very good places in the box next the stage-box, front and second\\nrow; the three old ones behind, of course. I was particularly\\ndisappointed at seeing nothing of Mr. Crabbe. I felt sure of him when I\\nsaw that the boxes were fitted up with crimson velvet. The new Mr. Terry\\nwas Lord Ogleby, and Henry thinks he may do; but there was no acting\\nmore than moderate, and I was as much amused by the remembrances\\nconnected with \"Midas\" as with any part of it. The girls were very much\\ndelighted, but still prefer \"Don Juan;\" and I must say that I have seen\\nnobody on the stage who has been a more interesting character than that\\ncompound of cruelty and lust.\\n\\nIt was not possible for me to get the worsteds yesterday. I heard Edward\\nlast night pressing Henry to come to you, and I think Henry engaged to\\ngo there after his November collection. Nothing has been done as to S.\\nand S.[23] The books came to hand too late for him to have time for it\\nbefore he went. Mr. Hastings never hinted at Eliza in the smallest\\ndegree. Henry knew nothing of Mr. Trimmer\\'s death. I tell you these\\nthings that you may not have to ask them over again.\\n\\nThere is a new clerk sent down to Alton, a Mr. Edmund Williams, a young\\nman whom Henry thinks most highly of, and he turns out to be a son of\\nthe luckless Williamses of Grosvenor Place.\\n\\nI long to have you hear Mr. H.\\'s opinion of P. and P. His admiring my\\nElizabeth so much is particularly welcome to me.\\n\\nInstead of saving my superfluous wealth for you to spend, I am going to\\ntreat myself with spending it myself. I hope, at least, that I shall\\nfind some poplin at Layton and Shear\\'s that will tempt me to buy it. If\\nI do, it shall be sent to Chawton, as half will be for you; for I depend\\nupon your being so kind as to accept it, being the main point. It will\\nbe a great pleasure to me. Don\\'t say a word. I only wish you could\\nchoose too. I shall send twenty yards.\\n\\nNow for Bath. Poor F. Cage has suffered a good deal from her accident.\\nThe noise of the White Hart was terrible to her. They will keep her\\nquiet, I dare say. She is not so much delighted with the place as the\\nrest of the party; probably, as she says herself, from having been less\\nwell, but she thinks she should like it better in the season. The\\nstreets are very empty now, and the shops not so gay as she expected.\\nThey are at No. 1 Henrietta Street, the corner of Laura Place, and have\\nno acquaintance at present but the Bramstons.\\n\\nLady Bridges drinks at the Cross Bath, her son at the Hot, and Louisa is\\ngoing to bathe. Dr. Parry seems to be half starving Mr. Bridges, for he\\nis restricted to much such a diet as James\\'s, bread, water and meat, and\\nis never to eat so much of that as he wishes, and he is to walk a great\\ndeal,--walk till he drops, I believe,--gout or no gout. It really is to\\nthat purpose. I have not exaggerated.\\n\\nCharming weather for you and us, and the travellers, and everybody. You\\nwill take your walk this afternoon, and . . .\\n\\n  Henrietta Street, the autumn of 1813.\\n    Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\n      By favor of Mr. Gray.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[20] Eliza, Henry Austen\\'s first wife, who had died in the earlier part\\nof this year.\\n\\n[21] \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\n\\n[22] Lizzy and Marianne.\\n\\n[23] \"Sense and Sensibility.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I hope you have had it by this time, and that it has found\\nyou all well, and my mother no more in need of leeches. Whether this\\nwill be delivered to you by Henry on Saturday evening, or by the postman\\non Sunday morning, I know not, as he has lately recollected something of\\nan engagement for Saturday, which perhaps may delay his visit. He seems\\ndetermined to come to you soon, however.\\n\\nI hope you will receive the gown to-morrow, and may be able with\\ntolerable honesty to say that you like the color. It was bought at\\nGrafton House, where, by going very early, we got immediate attendance\\nand went on very comfortably. I only forgot the one particular thing\\nwhich I had always resolved to buy there,--a white silk\\nhandkerchief,--and was therefore obliged to give six shillings for one\\nat Crook and Besford's; which reminds me to say that the worsteds ought\\nalso to be at Chawton to-morrow, and that I shall be very happy to hear\\nthey are approved. I had not much time for deliberation.\\n\\nWe are now all four of us young ladies sitting round the circular table\\nin the inner room writing our letters, while the two brothers are\\nhaving a comfortable coze in the room adjoining. It is to be a quiet\\nevening, much to the satisfaction of four of the six. My eyes are quite\\ntired of dust and lamps.\\n\\nThe letter you forwarded from Edward, junr., has been duly received. He\\nhas been shooting most prosperously at home, and dining at Chilham\\nCastle and with Mr. Scudamore.\\n\\nMy cap is come home, and I like it very much. Fanny has one also; hers\\nis white sarsenet and lace, of a different shape from mine, more fit for\\nmorning carriage wear, which is what it is intended for, and is in shape\\nexceedingly like our own satin and lace of last winter; shaped round the\\nface exactly like it, with pipes and more fulness, and a round crown\\ninserted behind. My cap has a peak in front. Large full bows of very\\nnarrow ribbon (old twopenny) are the thing. One over the right temple,\\nperhaps, and another at the left ear.\\n\\nHenry is not quite well. His stomach is rather deranged. You must keep\\nhim in rhubarb, and give him plenty of port and water. He caught his\\ncold farther back than I told you,--before he got to Matlock, somewhere\\nin his journey from the North; but the ill effects of that I hope are\\nnearly gone.\\n\\nWe returned from Grafton House only just in time for breakfast, and had\\nscarcely finished breakfast when the carriage came to the door. From\\neleven to half-past three we were hard at it; we did contrive to get to\\nHans Place for ten minutes. Mrs. T. was as affectionate and pleasing as\\never.\\n\\nAfter our return Mr. Tilson walked up from the Compting House and called\\nupon us, and these have been all our visitings.\\n\\nI have rejoiced more than once that I bought my writing-paper in the\\ncountry; we have not had a quarter of an hour to spare.\\n\\nI enclose the eighteen-pence due to my mother. The rose color was 6_s._\\nand the other 4_s._ per yard. There was but two yards and a quarter of\\nthe dark slate in the shop, but the man promised to match it and send it\\noff correctly.\\n\\nFanny bought her Irish at Newton's in Leicester Square, and I took the\\nopportunity of thinking about your Irish, and seeing one piece of the\\nyard wide at 4_s._, and it seemed to me very good; good enough for your\\npurpose. It might at least be worth your while to go there, if you have\\nno other engagements. Fanny is very much pleased with the stockings she\\nhas bought of Remmington, silk at 12_s._, cotton at 4_s._ 3_d._ She\\nthinks them great bargains, but I have not seen them yet, as my hair was\\ndressing when the man and the stockings came.\\n\\nThe poor girls and their teeth! I have not mentioned them yet, but we\\nwere a whole hour at Spence's, and Lizzy's were filed and lamented over\\nagain, and poor Marianne had two taken out after all, the two just\\nbeyond the eye teeth, to make room for those in front. When her doom was\\nfixed, Fanny, Lizzy, and I walked into the next room, where we heard\\neach of the two sharp and hasty screams.\\n\\nThe little girls' teeth I can suppose in a critical state, but I think\\nhe must be a lover of teeth and money and mischief, to parade about\\nFanny's. I would not have had him look at mine for a shilling a tooth\\nand double it. It was a disagreeable hour.\\n\\nWe then went to Wedgwood's, where my brother and Fanny chose a\\ndinner-set. I believe the pattern is a small lozenge in purple, between\\nlines of narrow gold, and it is to have the crest.\\n\\nWe must have been three-quarters of an hour at Grafton House, Edward\\nsitting by all the time with wonderful patience. There Fanny bought the\\nnet for Anna's gown, and a beautiful square veil for herself. The edging\\nthere is very cheap. I was tempted by some, and I bought some very nice\\nplaiting lace at 3_s._ 4_d._\\n\\nFanny desires me to tell Martha, with her kind love, that Birchall\\nassured her there was no second set of Hook's Lessons for Beginners, and\\nthat, by my advice, she has therefore chosen her a set by another\\ncomposer. I thought she would rather have something than not. It costs\\nsix shillings.\\n\\nWith love to you all, including Triggs, I remain,\\n\\n                            Yours very affectionately,       J.

       " \"                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Thursday (Sept. 23).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Thank you five hundred and forty times for the\\nexquisite piece of workmanship which was brought into the room this\\nmorning, while we were at breakfast, with some very inferior works of\\nart in the same way, and which I read with high glee, much delighted\\nwith everything it told, whether good or bad. It is so rich in striking\\nintelligence that I hardly know what to reply to first. I believe finery\\nmust have it.\\n\\nI am extremely glad that you like the poplin. I thought it would have my\\nmother's approbation, but was not so confident of yours. Remember that\\nit is a present. Do not refuse me. I am very rich.\\n\\nMrs. Clement is very welcome to her little boy, and to my\\ncongratulations into the bargain, if ever you think of giving them. I\\nhope she will do well. Her sister in Lucina, Mrs. H. Gipps, does too\\nwell, we think. Mary P. wrote on Sunday that she had been three days on\\nthe sofa. Sackree does not approve it.\\n\\nWell, there is some comfort in the Mrs. Hulbart's not coming to you, and\\nI am happy to hear of the honey. I was thinking of it the other day. Let\\nme know when you begin the new tea and the new white wine. My present\\nelegances have not yet made me indifferent to such matters. I am still a\\ncat if I see a mouse.\\n\\nI am glad you like our caps, but Fanny is out of conceit with hers\\nalready; she finds that she has been buying a new cap without having a\\nnew pattern, which is true enough. She is rather out of luck to like\\nneither her gown nor her cap, but I do not much mind it, because besides\\nthat I like them both myself, I consider it as a thing of course at her\\ntime of life,--one of the sweet taxes of youth to choose in a hurry and\\nmake bad bargains.\\n\\nI wrote to Charles yesterday, and Fanny has had a letter from him\\nto-day, principally to make inquiries about the time of their visit\\nhere, to which mine was an answer beforehand; so he will probably write\\nagain soon to fix his week. I am best pleased that Cassy does not go to\\nyou.\\n\\nNow, what have we been doing since I wrote last? The Mr. K.'s[24] came a\\nlittle before dinner on Monday, and Edward went to the church with the\\ntwo seniors, but there is no inscription yet drawn up. They are very\\ngood-natured, you know, and civil, and all that, but are not\\nparticularly superfine; however, they ate their dinner and drank their\\ntea, and went away, leaving their lovely Wadham in our arms, and I wish\\nyou had seen Fanny and me running backwards and forwards with his\\nbreeches from the little chintz to the white room before we went to bed,\\nin the greatest of frights lest he should come upon us before we had\\ndone it all. There had been a mistake in the housemaid's preparation,\\nand they were gone to bed.\\n\\nHe seems a very harmless sort of young man, nothing to like or dislike\\nin him,--goes out shooting or hunting with the two others all the\\nmorning, and plays at whist and makes queer faces in the evening. . . .\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[24] Knatchbulls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Monday (Oct. 11).\\n\\n[MY DEAREST AUNT CASS.,--I have just asked Aunt Jane to let me write a\\nlittle in her letter, but she does not like it, so I won\\'t. Good-by!]\\n\\nYou will have Edward\\'s letter to-morrow. He tells me that he did not\\nsend you any news to interfere with mine, but I do not think there is\\nmuch for anybody to send at present.\\n\\nWe had our dinner-party on Wednesday, with the addition of Mrs. and Miss\\nMilles, who were under a promise of dining here in their return from\\nEastwell, whenever they paid their visit of duty there, and it happened\\nto be paid on that day. Both mother and daughter are much as I have\\nalways found them. I like the mother--first, because she reminds me of\\nMrs. Birch; and, secondly, because she is cheerful and grateful for what\\nshe is at the age of ninety and upwards. The day was pleasant enough. I\\nsat by Mr. Chisholme, and we talked away at a great rate about nothing\\nworth hearing.\\n\\nIt was a mistake as to the day of the Sherers going being fixed; they\\nare ready, but are waiting for Mr. Paget\\'s answer.\\n\\nI inquired of Mrs. Milles after Jemima Brydges, and was quite grieved to\\nhear that she was obliged to leave Canterbury some months ago on account\\nof her debts, and is nobody knows where. What an unprosperous family!\\n\\nOn Saturday, soon after breakfast, Mr. J. P. left us for Norton Court. I\\nlike him very much. He gives me the idea of a very amiable young man,\\nonly too diffident to be so agreeable as he might be. He was out the\\nchief of each morning with the other two, shooting and getting wet\\nthrough. To-morrow we are to know whether he and a hundred young ladies\\nwill come here for the ball. I do not much expect any.\\n\\nThe Deedes cannot meet us; they have engagements at home. I will finish\\nthe Deedes by saying that they are not likely to come here till quite\\nlate in my stay,--the very last week perhaps; and I do not expect to see\\nthe Moores at all. They are not solicited till after Edward\\'s return\\nfrom Hampshire.\\n\\nMonday, November 15, is the day now fixed for our setting out.\\n\\nPoor Basingstoke races! There seem to have been two particularly\\nwretched days on purpose for them; and Weyhill week does not begin much\\nhappier.\\n\\nWe were quite surprised by a letter from Anna at Tollard Royal, last\\nSaturday; but perfectly approve her going, and only regret they should\\nall go so far to stay so few days.\\n\\nWe had thunder and lightning here on Thursday morning, between five and\\nseven; no very bad thunder, but a great deal of lightning. It has given\\nthe commencement of a season of wind and rain, and perhaps for the next\\nsix weeks we shall not have two dry days together.\\n\\nLizzy is very much obliged to you for your letter and will answer it\\nsoon, but has so many things to do that it may be four or five days\\nbefore she can. This is quite her own message, spoken in rather a\\ndesponding tone. Your letter gave pleasure to all of us; we had all the\\nreading of it of course,--I three times, as I undertook, to the great\\nrelief of Lizzy, to read it to Sackree, and afterwards to Louisa.\\n\\nSackree does not at all approve of Mary Doe and her nuts,--on the score\\nof propriety rather than health. She saw some signs of going after her\\nin George and Henry, and thinks if you could give the girl a check, by\\nrather reproving her for taking anything seriously about nuts which they\\nsaid to her, it might be of use. This, of course, is between our three\\ndiscreet selves, a scene of triennial bliss.\\n\\nMrs. Breton called here on Saturday. I never saw her before. She is a\\nlarge, ungenteel woman, with self-satisfied and would-be elegant\\nmanners.\\n\\nWe are certain of some visitors to-morrow. Edward Bridges comes for two\\nnights in his way from Lenham to Ramsgate, and brings a friend--name\\nunknown--but supposed to be a Mr. Harpur, a neighboring clergyman; and\\nMr. R. Mascall is to shoot with the young men, which it is to be\\nsupposed will end in his staying dinner.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Lushington, M.P. for Canterbury, and manager of the\\nLodge Hounds, dines here, and stays the night. He is chiefly young\\nEdward\\'s acquaintance. If I can I will get a frank from him, and write\\nto you all the sooner. I suppose the Ashford ball will furnish\\nsomething.\\n\\nAs I wrote of my nephews with a little bitterness in my last, I think\\nit particularly incumbent on me to do them justice now, and I have great\\npleasure in saying that they were both at the Sacrament yesterday. After\\nhaving much praised or much blamed anybody, one is generally sensible of\\nsomething just the reverse soon afterwards. Now these two boys who are\\nout with the foxhounds will come home and disgust me again by some habit\\nof luxury or some proof of sporting mania, unless I keep it off by this\\nprediction. They amuse themselves very comfortably in the evening by\\nnetting; they are each about a rabbit net, and sit as deedily to it,\\nside by side, as any two Uncle Franks could do.\\n\\nI am looking over \"Self-Control\" again, and my opinion is confirmed of\\nits being an excellently meant, elegantly written work, without anything\\nof nature or probability in it. I declare I do not know whether Laura\\'s\\npassage down the American river is not the most natural, possible,\\nevery-day thing she ever does.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--Dear me! what is to become of me? Such a long letter!\\nTwo-and-forty lines in the second page. Like Harriot Byron, I ask, what\\nam I to do with my gratitude? I can do nothing but thank you and go on.\\nA few of your inquiries, I think, are replied to _en avance_.\\n\\nThe name of F. Cage\\'s drawing-master is O\\'Neil. We are exceedingly\\namused with your Shalden news, and your self-reproach on the subject of\\nMrs. Stockwell made me laugh heartily. I rather wondered that\\nJohncock,[25] the only person in the room, could help laughing too. I had\\nnot heard before of her having the measles. Mrs. H. and Alethea\\'s\\nstaying till Friday was quite new to me; a good plan, however. I could\\nnot have settled it better myself, and am glad they found so much in the\\nhouse to approve, and I hope they will ask Martha to visit them. I\\nadmire the sagacity and taste of Charlotte Williams. Those large dark\\neyes always judge well. I will compliment her by naming a heroine after\\nher.\\n\\nEdward has had all the particulars of the building, etc., read to him\\ntwice over, and seems very well satisfied. A narrow door to the pantry\\nis the only subject of solicitude; it is certainly just the door which\\nshould not be narrow, on account of the trays; but if a case of\\nnecessity, it must be borne.\\n\\nI knew there was sugar in the tin, but had no idea of there being enough\\nto last through your company. All the better. You ought not to think\\nthis new loaf better than the other, because that was the first of five\\nwhich all came together. Something of fancy, perhaps, and something of\\nimagination.\\n\\nDear Mrs. Digweed! I cannot bear that she should not be foolishly happy\\nafter a ball. I hope Miss Yates and her companions were all well the day\\nafter their arrival. I am thoroughly rejoiced that Miss Benn has placed\\nherself in lodgings, though I hope they may not be long necessary.\\n\\nNo letter from Charles yet.\\n\\nSouthey\\'s \"Life of Nelson.\" I am tired of \"Lives of Nelson,\" being that\\nI never read any. I will read this, however, if Frank is mentioned in\\nit.\\n\\nHere am I in Kent, with one brother in the same county and another\\nbrother\\'s wife, and see nothing of them, which seems unnatural. It will\\nnot last so forever, I trust. I should like to have Mrs. F. A. and her\\nchildren here for a week, but not a syllable of that nature is ever\\nbreathed. I wish her last visit had not been so long a one.\\n\\nI wonder whether Mrs. Tilson has ever lain-in. Mention it if it ever\\ncomes to your knowledge, and we shall hear of it by the same post from\\nHenry.\\n\\nMr. Rob. Mascall breakfasted here; he eats a great deal of butter. I\\ndined upon goose yesterday, which, I hope, will secure a good sale of my\\nsecond edition. Have you any tomatas? Fanny and I regale on them every\\nday.\\n\\nDisastrous letters from the Plumptres and Oxendens. Refusals\\neverywhere--a blank _partout_--and it is not quite certain whether we go\\nor not; something may depend upon the disposition of Uncle Edward when\\nhe comes, and upon what we hear at Chilham Castle this morning, for we\\nare going to pay visits. We are going to each house at Chilham and to\\nMystole. I shall like seeing the Faggs. I shall like it all, except that\\nwe are to set out so early that I have not time to write as I would\\nwish.\\n\\nEdwd. Bridges\\'s friend is a Mr. Hawker, I find, not Harpur. I would not\\nhave you sleep in such an error for the world.\\n\\nMy brother desires his best love and thanks for all your information. He\\nhopes the roots of the old beech have been dug away enough to allow a\\nproper covering of mould and turf. He is sorry for the necessity of\\nbuilding the new coin, but hopes they will contrive that the doorway\\nshould be of the usual width,--if it must be contracted on one side, by\\nwidening it on the other. The appearance need not signify. And he\\ndesires me to say that your being at Chawton when he is will be quite\\nnecessary. You cannot think it more indispensable than he does. He is\\nvery much obliged to you for your attention to everything. Have you any\\nidea of returning with him to Henrietta Street and finishing your visit\\nthen? Tell me your sweet little innocent ideas.\\n\\nEverything of love and kindness, proper and improper, must now suffice.\\n\\n                             Yours very affectionately,      J.

       " '                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Thursday (Oct. 14).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Now I will prepare for Mr. Lushington, and as it\\nwill be wisest also to prepare for his not coming, or my not getting a\\nfrank, I shall write very close from the first, and even leave room for\\nthe seal in the proper place. When I have followed up my last with this\\nI shall feel somewhat less unworthy of you than the state of our\\ncorrespondence now requires.\\n\\nI left off in a great hurry to prepare for our morning visits. Of course\\nwas ready a good deal the first, and need not have hurried so much.\\nFanny wore her new gown and cap. I was surprised to find Mystole so\\npretty.\\n\\nThe ladies were at home. I was in luck, and saw Lady Fagg and all her\\nfive daughters, with an old Mrs. Hamilton, from Canterbury, and Mrs. and\\nMiss Chapman, from Margate, into the bargain. I never saw so plain a\\nfamily,--five sisters so very plain! They are as plain as the Foresters,\\nor the Franfraddops, or the Seagraves, or the Rivers, excluding Sophy.\\nMiss Sally Fagg has a pretty figure, and that comprises all the good\\nlooks of the family.\\n\\nIt was stupidish; Fanny did her part very well, but there was a lack of\\ntalk altogether, and the three friends in the house only sat by and\\nlooked at us. However, Miss Chapman\\'s name is Laura, and she had a\\ndouble flounce to her gown. You really must get some flounces. Are not\\nsome of your large stock of white morning gowns just in a happy state\\nfor a flounce--too short? Nobody at home at either house in Chilham.\\n\\nEdward Bridges and his friend did not forget to arrive. The friend is a\\nMr. Wigram, one of the three-and-twenty children of a great rich\\nmercantile, Sir Robert Wigram, an old acquaintance of the Footes, but\\nvery recently known to Edward B. The history of his coming here is,\\nthat, intending to go from Ramsgate to Brighton, Edw. B. persuaded him\\nto take Lenham on his way, which gave him the convenience of Mr. W.\\'s\\ngig, and the comfort of not being alone there; but, probably thinking a\\nfew days of Gm. would be the cheapest and pleasantest way of\\nentertaining his friend and himself, offered a visit here, and here they\\nstay till to-morrow.\\n\\nMr. W. is about five or six-and-twenty, not ill-looking, and not\\nagreeable. He is certainly no addition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike\\nmanner, but very silent. They say his name is Henry, a proof how\\nunequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed. I have seen many a John and\\nThomas much more agreeable.\\n\\nWe have got rid of Mr. R. Mascall, however. I did not like him, either.\\nHe talks too much, and is conceited, besides having a vulgarly shaped\\nmouth. He slept here on Tuesday, so that yesterday Fanny and I sat down\\nto breakfast with six gentlemen to admire us.\\n\\nWe did not go to the ball. It was left to her to decide, and at last she\\ndetermined against it. She knew that it would be a sacrifice on the part\\nof her father and brothers if they went, and I hope it will prove that\\nshe has not sacrificed much. It is not likely that there should have\\nbeen anybody there whom she would care for. I was very glad to be spared\\nthe trouble of dressing and going, and being weary before it was half\\nover; so my gown and my cap are still unworn. It will appear at last,\\nperhaps, that I might have done without either. I produced my brown\\nbombazine yesterday, and it was very much admired indeed, and I like it\\nbetter than ever.\\n\\nYou have given many particulars of the state of Chawton House, but still\\nwe want more. Edward wants to be expressly told that all the round\\ntower, etc., is entirely down, and the door from the best room stopped\\nup; he does not know enough of the appearance of things in that quarter.\\n\\nHe heard from Bath yesterday. Lady B. continues very well, and Dr.\\nParry\\'s opinion is, that while the water agrees with her she ought to\\nremain there, which throws their coming away at a greater uncertainty\\nthan we had supposed. It will end, perhaps, in a fit of the gout, which\\nmay prevent her coming away. Louisa thinks her mother\\'s being so well\\nmay be quite as much owing to her being so much out of doors as to the\\nwater. Lady B. is going to try the hot pump, the Cross bath being about\\nto be painted. Louisa is particularly well herself, and thinks the water\\nhas been of use to her. She mentioned our inquiries, etc., to Mr. and\\nMrs. Alex. Evelyn, and had their best compliments and thanks to give in\\nreturn. Dr. Parry does not expect Mr. E. to last much longer.\\n\\nOnly think of Mrs. Holder\\'s being dead! Poor woman, she has done the\\nonly thing in the world she could possibly do to make one cease to abuse\\nher. Now, if you please, Hooper must have it in his power to do more by\\nhis uncle. Lucky for the little girl. An Anne Ekins can hardly be so\\nunfit for the care of a child as a Mrs. Holder.\\n\\nA letter from Wrotham yesterday offering an early visit here, and Mr.\\nand Mrs. Moore and one child are to come on Monday for ten days. I hope\\nCharles and Fanny may not fix the same time, but if they come at all in\\nOctober they must. What is the use of hoping? The two parties of\\nchildren is the chief evil.\\n\\nTo be sure, here we are; the very thing has happened, or rather\\nworse,--a letter from Charles this very morning, which gives us reason\\nto suppose they may come here to-day. It depends upon the weather, and\\nthe weather now is very fine. No difficulties are made, however, and,\\nindeed, there will be no want of room; but I wish there were no Wigrams\\nand Lushingtons in the way to fill up the table and make us such a\\nmotley set. I cannot spare Mr. Lushington either, because of his frank,\\nbut Mr. Wigram does no good to anybody. I cannot imagine how a man can\\nhave the impudence to come into a family party for three days, where he\\nis quite a stranger, unless he knows himself to be agreeable on\\nundoubted authority. He and Edw. B. are going to ride to Eastwell, and\\nas the boys are hunting, and my brother is gone to Canty., Fanny and I\\nhave a quiet morning before us.\\n\\nEdward has driven off poor Mrs. Salkeld. It was thought a good\\nopportunity of doing something towards clearing the house. By her own\\ndesire Mrs. Fanny[26] is to be put in the room next the nursery, her baby\\nin a little bed by her; and as Cassy is to have the closet within, and\\nBetsey William\\'s little hole, they will be all very snug together. I\\nshall be most happy to see dear Charles, and he will be as happy as he\\ncan with a cross child, or some such care, pressing on him at the time.\\nI should be very happy in the idea of seeing little Cassy again, too,\\ndid not I fear she would disappoint me by some immediate\\ndisagreeableness. . . .\\n\\nThe comfort of the billiard-table here is very great; it draws all the\\ngentlemen to it whenever they are within, especially after dinner, so\\nthat my brother, Fanny, and I have the library to ourselves in\\ndelightful quiet. There is no truth in the report of G. Hatton being to\\nmarry Miss Wemyss. He desires it may be contradicted.\\n\\nHave you done anything about our present to Miss Benn? I suppose she\\nmust have a bed at my mother\\'s whenever she dines there. How will they\\nmanage as to inviting her when you are gone? and if they invite, how\\nwill they continue to entertain her?\\n\\nLet me know as many of your parting arrangements as you can, as to wine,\\netc. I wonder whether the ink-bottle has been filled. Does butcher\\'s\\nmeat keep up at the same price, and is not bread lower than 2_s._ 6_d._?\\nMary\\'s blue gown! My mother must be in agonies. I have a great mind to\\nhave my blue gown dyed some time or other. I proposed it once to you,\\nand you made some objection, I forget what. It is the fashion of\\nflounces that gives it particular expediency.\\n\\nMrs. and Miss Wildman have just been here. Miss is very plain. I wish\\nLady B. may be returned before we leave Gm., that Fanny may spend the\\ntime of her father\\'s absence at Goodnestone, which is what she would\\nprefer.\\n\\n_Friday._--They came last night at about seven. We had given them up,\\nbut I still expected them to come. Dessert was nearly over; a better\\ntime for arriving than an hour and a half earlier. They were late\\nbecause they did not set out earlier, and did not allow time enough.\\nCharles did not aim at more than reaching Sittingbourne by three, which\\ncould not have brought them here by dinner-time. They had a very rough\\npassage; he would not have ventured if he had known how bad it would be.\\n\\nHowever, here they are, safe and well, just like their own nice selves,\\nFanny looking as neat and white this morning as possible, and dear\\nCharles all affectionate, placid, quiet, cheerful good-humor. They are\\nboth looking very well, but poor little Cassy is grown extremely thin,\\nand looks poorly. I hope a week\\'s country air and exercise may do her\\ngood. I am sorry to say it can be but a week. The baby does not appear\\nso large in proportion as she was, nor quite so pretty, but I have seen\\nvery little of her. Cassy was too tired and bewildered just at first to\\nseem to know anybody. We met them in the hall--the women and girl part\\nof us--but before we reached the library she kissed me very\\naffectionately, and has since seemed to recollect me in the same way.\\n\\nIt was quite an evening of confusion, as you may suppose. At first we\\nwere all walking about from one part of the house to the other; then\\ncame a fresh dinner in the breakfast-room for Charles and his wife,\\nwhich Fanny and I attended; then we moved into the library, were joined\\nby the dining-room people, were introduced, and so forth; and then we\\nhad tea and coffee, which was not over till past ten. Billiards again\\ndrew all the odd ones away; and Edward, Charles, the two Fannies, and I\\nsat snugly talking. I shall be glad to have our numbers a little\\nreduced, and by the time you receive this we shall be only a family,\\nthough a large family, party. Mr. Lushington goes to-morrow.\\n\\nNow I must speak of him, and I like him very much. I am sure he is\\nclever, and a man of taste. He got a volume of Milton last night, and\\nspoke of it with warmth. He is quite an M. P., very smiling, with an\\nexceeding good address and readiness of language. I am rather in love\\nwith him. I dare say he is ambitious and insincere. He puts me in mind\\nof Mr. Dundas. He has a wide smiling mouth, and very good teeth, and\\nsomething the same complexion and nose. He is a much shorter man, with\\nMartha\\'s leave. Does Martha never hear from Mrs. Craven? Is Mrs. Craven\\nnever at home?\\n\\nWe breakfasted in the dining-room to-day, and are now all pretty well\\ndispersed and quiet. Charles and George are gone out shooting together,\\nto Winnigates and Seaton Wood. I asked on purpose to tell Henry. Mr.\\nLushington and Edwd. are gone some other way. I wish Charles may kill\\nsomething; but this high wind is against their sport.\\n\\nLady Williams is living at the Rose at Sittingbourne; they called upon\\nher yesterday; she cannot live at Sheerness, and as soon as she gets to\\nSittingbourne is quite well. In return for all your matches, I announce\\nthat her brother William is going to marry a Miss Austen, of a Wiltshire\\nfamily, who say they are related to us.\\n\\nI talk to Cassy about Chawton; she remembers much, but does not\\nvolunteer on the subject. Poor little love! I wish she were not so very\\nPalmery, but it seems stronger than ever. I never knew a wife\\'s family\\nfeatures have such undue influence.\\n\\nPapa and mamma have not yet made up their mind as to parting with her or\\nnot; the chief, indeed the only, difficulty with mamma is a very\\nreasonable one, the child\\'s being very unwilling to leave them. When it\\nwas mentioned to her she did not like the idea of it at all. At the same\\ntime she has been suffering so much lately from sea-sickness that her\\nmamma cannot bear to have her much on board this winter. Charles is\\nless inclined to part with her. I do not know how it will end, or what\\nis to determine it. He desires his best love to you, and has not written\\nbecause he has not been able to decide. They are both very sensible of\\nyour kindness on the occasion.\\n\\nI have made Charles furnish me with something to say about young\\nKendall. He is going on very well. When he first joined the \"Namur,\" my\\nbrother did not find him forward enough to be what they call put in the\\noffice, and therefore placed him under the schoolmaster; but he is very\\nmuch improved, and goes into the office now every afternoon, still\\nattending school in the morning.\\n\\nThis cold weather comes very fortunately for Edward\\'s nerves, with such\\na house full; it suits him exactly; he is all alive and cheerful. Poor\\nJames, on the contrary, must be running his toes into the fire. I find\\nthat Mary Jane Fowle was very near returning with her brother and paying\\nthem a visit on board. I forget exactly what hindered her; I believe the\\nCheltenham scheme. I am glad something did. They are to go to Cheltenham\\non Monday se\\'nnight. I don\\'t vouch for their going, you know; it only\\ncomes from one of the family.\\n\\nNow I think I have written you a good-sized letter, and may deserve\\nwhatever I can get in reply. Infinities of love. I must distinguish\\nthat of Fanny, senior, who particularly desires to be remembered to you\\nall.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                          J.

We are all very glad to hear\\nthat the Adams are gone, and hope Dame Libscombe will be more happy now\\nwith her deaffy child, as she calls it, but I am afraid there is not\\nmuch chance of her remaining long sole mistress of her house.\\n\\nI am sorry you had not any better news to send us of our hare, poor\\nlittle thing! I thought it would not live long in that _Pondy House_; I\\ndon\\'t wonder that Mary Doe is very sorry it is dead, because we promised\\nher that if it was alive when we came back to Chawton, we would reward\\nher for her trouble.\\n\\nPapa is much obliged to you for ordering the scrubby firs to be cut\\ndown; I think he was rather frightened at first about the great oak.\\nFanny quite believed it, for she exclaimed, \"Dear me, what a pity, how\\ncould they be so stupid!\" I hope by this time they have put up some\\nhurdles for the sheep, or turned out the cart-horses from the lawn.\\n\\nPray tell grandmamma that we have begun getting seeds for her; I hope we\\nshall be able to get her a nice collection, but I am afraid this wet\\nweather is very much against them. How glad I am to hear she has had\\nsuch good success with her chickens, but I wish there had been more\\nbantams amongst them. I am very sorry to hear of poor Lizzie\\'s fate.\\n\\nI must now tell you something about our poor people. I believe you know\\nold Mary Croucher; she gets _maderer_ and _maderer_ every day. Aunt Jane\\nhas been to see her, but it was on one of her rational days. Poor Will\\nAmos hopes your skewers are doing well; he has left his house in the\\npoor Row, and lives in a barn at Builting. We asked him why he went\\naway, and he said the fleas were so starved when he came back from\\nChawton that they all flew upon him and _eenermost_ eat him up.\\n\\nHow unlucky it is that the weather is so wet! Poor Uncle Charles has\\ncome home half drowned every day.\\n\\nI don\\'t think little Fanny is quite so pretty as she was; one reason is\\nbecause she wears short petticoats, I believe. I hope Cook is better;\\nshe was very unwell the day we went away. Papa has given me\\nhalf-a-dozen new pencils, which are very good ones indeed; I draw every\\nother day. I hope you go and whip Lucy Chalcraft every night.\\n\\nMiss Clewes begs me to give her very best respects to you; she is very\\nmuch obliged to you for your kind inquiries after her. Pray give my duty\\nto grandmamma and love to Miss Floyd. I remain, my dear Aunt Cassandra,\\nyour very affectionate niece,\\n\\n                                               ELIZTH. KNIGHT.\\n\\n_Thursday._--I think Lizzy\\'s letter will entertain you. Thank you for\\nyours just received. To-morrow shall be fine if possible. You will be at\\nGuildford before our party set off. They only go to Key Street, as Mr.\\nStreet the Purser lives there, and they have promised to dine and sleep\\nwith him.\\n\\nCassy\\'s looks are much mended. She agrees pretty well with her cousins,\\nbut is not quite happy among them; they are too many and too boisterous\\nfor her. I have given her your message, but she said nothing, and did\\nnot look as if the idea of going to Chawton again was a pleasant one.\\nThey have Edward\\'s carriage to Ospringe.\\n\\nI think I have just done a good deed,--extracted Charles from his wife\\nand children upstairs, and made him get ready to go out shooting, and\\nnot keep Mr. Moore waiting any longer.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Sherer and Joseph dined here yesterday very prettily. Edw.\\nand Geo. were absent,--gone for a night to Eastling. The two Fannies\\nwent to Canty. in the morning, and took Lou. and Cass. to try on new\\nstays. Harriet and I had a comfortable walk together. She desires her\\nbest love to you and kind remembrance to Henry. Fanny\\'s best love also.\\nI fancy there is to be another party to Canty. to-morrow,--Mr. and Mrs.\\nMoore and me.\\n\\nEdward thanks Henry for his letter. We are most happy to hear he is so\\nmuch better. I depend upon you for letting me know what he wishes as to\\nmy staying with him or not; you will be able to find out, I dare say. I\\nhad intended to beg you would bring one of my nightcaps with you, in\\ncase of my staying, but forgot it when I wrote on Tuesday. Edward is\\nmuch concerned about his pond; he cannot now doubt the fact of its\\nrunning out, which he was resolved to do as long as possible.\\n\\nI suppose my mother will like to have me write to her. I shall try at\\nleast.\\n\\nNo; I have never seen the death of Mrs. Crabbe. I have only just been\\nmaking out from one of his prefaces that he probably was married. It is\\nalmost ridiculous. Poor woman! I will comfort him as well as I can, but\\nI do not undertake to be good to her children. She had better not leave\\nany.\\n\\nEdw. and Geo. set off this day week for Oxford. Our party will then be\\nvery small, as the Moores will be going about the same time. To enliven\\nus, Fanny proposes spending a few days soon afterwards at Fredville. It\\nwill really be a good opportunity, as her father will have a companion.\\nWe shall all three go to Wrotham, but Edwd. and I stay only a night\\nperhaps. Love to Mr. Tilson.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,     J. A.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    10 Henrietta St., Covent Garden, London.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Wednesday (Nov. 3).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I will keep this celebrated birthday by writing\\nto you; and as my pen seems inclined to write large, I will put my lines\\nvery close together. I had but just time to enjoy your letter yesterday\\nbefore Edward and I set off in the chair for Canty., and I allowed him\\nto hear the chief of it as we went along.\\n\\nWe rejoice sincerely in Henry\\'s gaining ground as he does, and hope\\nthere will be weather for him to get out every day this week, as the\\nlikeliest way of making him equal to what he plans for the next. If he\\nis tolerably well, the going into Oxfordshire will make him better, by\\nmaking him happier.\\n\\nCan it be that I have not given you the minutiæ of Edward\\'s plans? See,\\nhere they are: To go to Wrotham on Saturday the 13th, spend Sunday\\nthere, and be in town on Monday to dinner, and if agreeable to Henry,\\nspend one whole day with him, which day is likely to be Tuesday, and so\\ngo down to Chawton on Wednesday.\\n\\nBut now I cannot be quite easy without staying a little while with\\nHenry, unless he wishes it otherwise; his illness and the dull time of\\nyear together make me feel that it would be horrible of me not to offer\\nto remain with him, and therefore unless you know of any objection, I\\nwish you would tell him with my best love that I shall be most happy to\\nspend ten days or a fortnight in Henrietta St., if he will accept me. I\\ndo not offer more than a fortnight, because I shall then have been some\\ntime from home; but it will be a great pleasure to be with him, as it\\nalways is. I have the less regret and scruple on your account, because I\\nshall see you for a day and a half, and because you will have Edward for\\nat least a week. My scheme is to take Bookham in my way home for a few\\ndays, and my hope that Henry will be so good as to send me some part of\\nthe way thither. I have a most kind repetition of Mrs. Cooke\\'s two or\\nthree dozen invitations, with the offer of meeting me anywhere in one of\\nher airings.\\n\\nFanny\\'s cold is much better. By dosing and keeping her room on Sunday,\\nshe got rid of the worst of it, but I am rather afraid of what this day\\nmay do for her; she is gone to Canty. with Miss Clewes, Liz., and\\nMa^{rnne}, and it is but roughish weather for any one in a tender state.\\nMiss Clewes has been going to Canty. ever since her return, and it is\\nnow just accomplishing.\\n\\nEdward and I had a delightful morning for our drive there, I enjoyed it\\nthoroughly; but the day turned off before we were ready, and we came\\nhome in some rain and the apprehension of a great deal. It has not done\\nus any harm, however. He went to inspect the gaol, as a visiting\\nmagistrate, and took me with him. I was gratified, and went through all\\nthe feelings which people must go through, I think, in visiting such a\\nbuilding. We paid no other visits, only walked about snugly together,\\nand shopped. I bought a concert ticket and a sprig of flowers for my old\\nage.\\n\\nTo vary the subject from gay to grave with inimitable address, I shall\\nnow tell you something of the Bath party--and still a Bath party they\\nare, for a fit of the gout came on last week. The accounts of Lady B.\\nare as good as can be under such a circumstance; Dr. P. says it appears\\na good sort of gout, and her spirits are better than usual, but as to\\nher coming away, it is of course all uncertainty. I have very little\\ndoubt of Edward\\'s going down to Bath, if they have not left it when he\\nis in Hampshire; if he does, he will go on from Steventon, and then\\nreturn direct to London, without coming back to Chawton. This detention\\ndoes not suit his feelings. It may be rather a good thing, however, that\\nDr. P. should see Lady B. with the gout on her. Harriot was quite\\nwishing for it.\\n\\nThe day seems to improve. I wish my pen would too.\\n\\nSweet Mr. Ogle! I dare say he sees all the panoramas for nothing, has\\nfree admittance everywhere; he is so delightful! Now, you need not see\\nanybody else.\\n\\nI am glad to hear of our being likely to have a peep at Charles and\\nFanny at Christmas, but do not force poor Cass. to stay if she hates it.\\nYou have done very right as to Mrs. F. A. Your tidings of S. and S. give\\nme pleasure. I have never seen it advertised.\\n\\nHarriot, in a letter to Fanny to-day, inquires whether they sell cloths\\nfor pelisses at Bedford House, and, if they do, will be very much\\nobliged to you to desire them to send her down patterns, with the width\\nand prices; they may go from Charing Cross almost any day in the week,\\nbut if it is a ready-money house it will not do, for the _bru_ of _feu_\\nthe Archbishop says she cannot pay for it immediately. Fanny and I\\nsuspect they do not deal in the article.\\n\\nThe Sherers, I believe, are now really going to go; Joseph has had a bed\\nhere the last two nights, and I do not know whether this is not the day\\nof moving. Mrs. Sherer called yesterday to take leave. The weather looks\\nworse again.\\n\\nWe dine at Chilham Castle to-morrow, and I expect to find some\\namusement, but more from the concert the next day, as I am sure of\\nseeing several that I want to see. We are to meet a party from\\nGoodnestone, Lady B., Miss Hawley, and Lucy Foote, and I am to meet Mrs.\\nHarrison, and we are to talk about Ben and Anna. \"My dear Mrs.\\nHarrison,\" I shall say, \"I am afraid the young man has some of your\\nfamily madness; and though there often appears to be something of\\nmadness in Anna too, I think she inherits more of it from her mother\\'s\\nfamily than from ours.\" That is what I shall say, and I think she will\\nfind it difficult to answer me.\\n\\nI took up your letter again to refresh me, being somewhat tired, and was\\nstruck with the prettiness of the hand: it is really a very pretty hand\\nnow and then,--so small and so neat! I wish I could get as much into a\\nsheet of paper.[27] Another time I will take two days to make a letter\\nin: it is fatiguing to write a whole long one at once. I hope to hear\\nfrom you again on Sunday and again on Friday, the day before we move.\\nOn Monday, I suppose, you will be going to Streatham, to see quiet Mr.\\nHill and eat very bad baker\\'s bread.\\n\\nA fall in bread by the by. I hope my mother\\'s bill next week will show\\nit. I have had a very comfortable letter from her, one of her foolscap\\nsheets quite full of little home news. Anna was there the first of the\\ntwo days. An Anna sent away and an Anna fetched are different things.\\nThis will be an excellent time for Ben to pay his visit, now that we,\\nthe formidables, are absent.\\n\\nI did not mean to eat, but Mr. Johncock has brought in the tray, so I\\nmust. I am all alone. Edward is gone into his woods. At this present\\ntime I have five tables, eight-and-twenty chairs, and two fires all to\\nmyself.\\n\\nMiss Clewes is to be invited to go to the concert with us; there will be\\nmy brother\\'s place and ticket for her, as he cannot go. He and the other\\nconnections of the Cages are to meet at Milgate that very day, to\\nconsult about a proposed alteration of the Maidstone road, in which the\\nCages are very much interested. Sir Brook comes here in the morning, and\\nthey are to be joined by Mr. Deedes at Ashford. The loss of the concert\\nwill be no great evil to the Squire. We shall be a party of three ladies\\ntherefore, and to meet three ladies.\\n\\nWhat a convenient carriage Henry\\'s is, to his friends in general! Who\\nhas it next? I am glad William\\'s going is voluntary, and on no worse\\ngrounds. An inclination for the country is a venial fault. He has more\\nof Cowper than of Johnson in him,--fonder of tame hares and blank verse\\nthan of the full tide of human existence at Charing Cross.\\n\\nOh! I have more of such sweet flattery from Miss Sharp. She is an\\nexcellent kind friend. I am read and admired in Ireland too. There is a\\nMrs. Fletcher, the wife of a judge, an old lady, and very good and very\\nclever, who is all curiosity to know about me,--what I am like, and so\\nforth. I am not known to her by name, however. This comes through Mrs.\\nCarrick, not through Mrs. Gore. You are quite out there.\\n\\nI do not despair of having my picture in the Exhibition at last,--all\\nwhite and red, with my head on one side; or perhaps I may marry young\\nMr. D\\'Arblay. I suppose in the mean time I shall owe dear Henry a great\\ndeal of money for printing, etc.\\n\\nI hope Mrs. Fletcher will indulge herself with S. and S. If I am to stay\\nin H. S., and if you should be writing home soon, I wish you would be so\\ngood as to give a hint of it, for I am not likely to write there again\\nthese ten days, having written yesterday.\\n\\nFanny has set her heart upon its being a Mr. Brett who is going to marry\\na Miss Dora Best, of this country. I dare say Henry has no objection.\\nPray, where did the boys sleep?\\n\\nThe Deedes come here on Monday to stay till Friday, so that we shall end\\nwith a flourish the last canto. They bring Isabella and one of the\\ngrown-ups, and will come in for a Canty. ball on Thursday. I shall be\\nglad to see them. Mrs. Deedes and I must talk rationally together, I\\nsuppose.\\n\\nEdward does not write to Henry, because of my writing so often. God\\nbless you. I shall be so glad to see you again, and I wish you many\\nhappy returns of this day. Poor Lord Howard! How he does cry about it!\\n\\n                                      Yours very truly,        J. A.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    10 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London.\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[27] I cannot pass this paragraph over without remarking that it is\\nhardly possible to imagine anything neater or prettier than Jane\\'s own\\nhand.

       " '                                  GODMERSHAM PARK, Saturday (Nov. 6).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Having half an hour before breakfast (very snug,\\nin my own room, lovely morning, excellent fire--fancy me!) I will give\\nyou some account of the last two days. And yet, what is there to be\\ntold? I shall get foolishly minute unless I cut the matter short.\\n\\nWe met only the Bretons at Chilham Castle, besides a Mr. and Mrs.\\nOsborne and a Miss Lee staying in the house, and were only fourteen\\naltogether. My brother and Fanny thought it the pleasantest party they\\nhad ever known there, and I was very well entertained by bits and\\nscraps. I had long wanted to see Dr. Breton, and his wife amuses me very\\nmuch with her affected refinement and elegance. Miss Lee I found very\\nconversable; she admires Crabbe as she ought. She is at an age of\\nreason, ten years older than myself at least. She was at the famous ball\\nat Chilham Castle, so of course you remember her.\\n\\nBy the by, as I must leave off being young, I find many _douceurs_ in\\nbeing a sort of _chaperon_, for I am put on the sofa near the fire, and\\ncan drink as much wine as I like. We had music in the evening: Fanny and\\nMiss Wildman played, and Mr. James Wildman sat close by and listened, or\\npretended to listen.\\n\\nYesterday was a day of dissipation all through: first came Sir Brook to\\ndissipate us before breakfast; then there was a call from Mr. Sherer,\\nthen a regular morning visit from Lady Honeywood in her way home from\\nEastwell; then Sir Brook and Edward set off; then we dined (five in\\nnumber) at half-past four; then we had coffee; and at six Miss Clewes,\\nFanny, and I drove away. We had a beautiful night for our frisks. We\\nwere earlier than we need have been, but after a time Lady B. and her\\ntwo companions appeared,--we had kept places for them; and there we sat,\\nall six in a row, under a side wall, I between Lucy Foote and Miss\\nClewes.\\n\\nLady B. was much what I expected; I could not determine whether she was\\nrather handsome or very plain. I liked her for being in a hurry to have\\nthe concert over and get away, and for getting away at last with a great\\ndeal of decision and promptness, not waiting to compliment and dawdle\\nand fuss about seeing dear Fanny, who was half the evening in another\\npart of the room with her friends the Plumptres. I am growing too\\nminute, so I will go to breakfast.\\n\\nWhen the concert was over, Mrs. Harrison and I found each other out, and\\nhad a very comfortable little complimentary friendly chat. She is a\\nsweet woman,--still quite a sweet woman in herself, and so like her\\nsister! I could almost have thought I was speaking to Mrs. Lefroy. She\\nintroduced me to her daughter, whom I think pretty, but most dutifully\\ninferior to _la Mère Beauté_. The Faggs and the Hammonds were\\nthere,--Wm. Hammond the only young man of renown. Miss looked very\\nhandsome, but I prefer her little smiling flirting sister Julia.\\n\\nI was just introduced at last to Mary Plumptre, but I should hardly know\\nher again. She was delighted with me, however, good enthusiastic soul!\\nAnd Lady B. found me handsomer than she expected, so you see I am not so\\nvery bad as you might think for.\\n\\nIt was twelve before we reached home. We were all dog-tired, but pretty\\nwell to-day: Miss Clewes says she has not caught cold, and Fanny\\'s does\\nnot seem worse. I was so tired that I began to wonder how I should get\\nthrough the ball next Thursday; but there will be so much more variety\\nthen in walking about, and probably so much less heat, that perhaps I\\nmay not feel it more. My china crape is still kept for the ball. Enough\\nof the concert.\\n\\nI had a letter from Mary yesterday. They travelled down to Cheltenham\\nlast Monday very safely, and are certainly to be there a month. Bath is\\nstill Bath. The H. Bridges must quit them early next week, and Louisa\\nseems not quite to despair of their all moving together, but to those\\nwho see at a distance there appears no chance of it. Dr. Parry does not\\nwant to keep Lady B. at Bath when she can once move. That is lucky. You\\nwill see poor Mr. Evelyn\\'s death.\\n\\nSince I wrote last, my 2nd edit. has stared me in the face. Mary tells\\nme that Eliza means to buy it. I wish she may. It can hardly depend upon\\nany more Fyfield Estates. I cannot help hoping that many will feel\\nthemselves obliged to buy it. I shall not mind imagining it a\\ndisagreeable duty to them, so as they do it. Mary heard before she left\\nhome that it was very much admired at Cheltenham, and that it was given\\nto Miss Hamilton. It is pleasant to have such a respectable writer\\nnamed. I cannot tire you, I am sure, on this subject, or I would\\napologize.\\n\\nWhat weather, and what news! We have enough to do to admire them both. I\\nhope you derive your full share of enjoyment from each.\\n\\nI have extended my lights and increased my acquaintance a good deal\\nwithin these two days. Lady Honeywood you know; I did not sit near\\nenough to be a perfect judge, but I thought her extremely pretty, and\\nher manners have all the recommendations of ease and good-humor and\\nunaffectedness; and going about with four horses and nicely dressed\\nherself, she is altogether a perfect sort of woman.\\n\\nOh, and I saw Mr. Gipps last night,--the useful Mr. Gipps, whose\\nattentions came in as acceptably to us in handing us to the carriage,\\nfor want of a better man, as they did to Emma Plumptre. I thought him\\nrather a good-looking little man.\\n\\nI long for your letter to-morrow, particularly that I may know my fate\\nas to London. My first wish is that Henry should really choose what he\\nlikes best; I shall certainly not be sorry if he does not want me.\\nMorning church to-morrow; I shall come back with impatient feelings.\\n\\nThe Sherers are gone, but the Pagets are not come: we shall therefore\\nhave Mr. S. again. Mr. Paget acts like an unsteady man. Dr. Hant,\\nhowever, gives him a very good character; what is wrong is to be imputed\\nto the lady. I dare say the house likes female government.\\n\\nI have a nice long black and red letter from Charles, but not\\ncommunicating much that I did not know.\\n\\nThere is some chance of a good ball next week, as far as females go.\\nLady Bridges may perhaps be there with some Knatchbulls. Mrs. Harrison\\nperhaps, with Miss Oxenden and the Miss Papillons; and if Mrs. Harrison,\\nthen Lady Fagg will come.\\n\\nThe shades of evening are descending, and I resume my interesting\\nnarrative. Sir Brook and my brother came back about four, and Sir Brook\\nalmost immediately set forward again to Goodnestone. We are to have\\nEdwd. B. to-morrow, to pay us another Sunday\\'s visit,--the last, for\\nmore reasons than one; they all come home on the same day that we go.\\nThe Deedes do not come till Tuesday; Sophia is to be the comer. She is a\\ndisputable beauty that I want much to see. Lady Eliz. Hatton and\\nAnnamaria called here this morning. Yes, they called; but I do not think\\nI can say anything more about them. They came, and they sat, and they\\nwent.\\n\\n_Sunday._--Dearest Henry! What a turn he has for being ill, and what a\\nthing bile is! This attack has probably been brought on in part by his\\nprevious confinement and anxiety; but, however it came, I hope it is\\ngoing fast, and that you will be able to send a very good account of him\\non Tuesday. As I hear on Wednesday, of course I shall not expect to hear\\nagain on Friday. Perhaps a letter to Wrotham would not have an ill\\neffect.\\n\\nWe are to be off on Saturday before the post comes in, as Edward takes\\nhis own horses all the way. He talks of nine o\\'clock. We shall bait at\\nLenham.\\n\\nExcellent sweetness of you to send me such a nice long letter; it made\\nits appearance, with one from my mother, soon after I and my impatient\\nfeelings walked in. How glad I am that I did what I did! I was only\\nafraid that you might think the offer superfluous, but you have set my\\nheart at ease. Tell Henry that I will stay with him, let it be ever so\\ndisagreeable to him.\\n\\nOh, dear me! I have not time on paper for half that I want to say. There\\nhave been two letters from Oxford,--one from George yesterday. They got\\nthere very safely,--Edwd. two hours behind the coach, having lost his\\nway in leaving London. George writes cheerfully and quietly; hopes to\\nhave Utterson\\'s rooms soon; went to lecture on Wednesday, states some of\\nhis expenses, and concludes with saying, \"I am afraid I shall be poor.\"\\nI am glad he thinks about it so soon. I believe there is no private\\ntutor yet chosen, but my brother is to hear from Edwd. on the subject\\nshortly.\\n\\nYou, and Mrs. H., and Catherine, and Alethea going about together in\\nHenry\\'s carriage seeing sights--I am not used to the idea of it yet. All\\nthat you are to see of Streatham, seen already! Your Streatham and my\\nBookham may go hang. The prospect of being taken down to Chawton by\\nHenry perfects the plan to me. I was in hopes of your seeing some\\nilluminations, and you have seen them. \"I thought you would come, and\\nyou did come.\" I am sorry he is not to come from the Baltic sooner. Poor\\nMary!\\n\\nMy brother has a letter from Louisa to-day of an unwelcome nature; they\\nare to spend the winter at Bath. It was just decided on. Dr. Parry\\nwished it, not from thinking the water necessary to Lady B., but that he\\nmight be better able to judge how far his treatment of her, which is\\ntotally different from anything she had been used to, is right; and I\\nsuppose he will not mind having a few more of her Ladyship\\'s guineas.\\nHis system is a lowering one. He took twelve ounces of blood from her\\nwhen the gout appeared, and forbids wine, etc. Hitherto the plan agrees\\nwith her. She is very well satisfied to stay, but it is a sore\\ndisappointment to Louisa and Fanny.\\n\\nThe H. Bridges leave them on Tuesday, and they mean to move into a\\nsmaller house; you may guess how Edward feels. There can be no doubt of\\nhis going to Bath now; I should not wonder if he brought Fanny Cage back\\nwith him.\\n\\nYou shall hear from me once more, some day or other.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,      J. A.\\n\\nWe do not like Mr. Hampson\\'s scheme.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    10 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                            HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (March 2, 1814).\\n\\nWe had altogether a very good journey, and everything at Cobham was\\ncomfortable. I could not pay Mr. Harrington! That was the only alas! of\\nthe business. I shall therefore return his bill, and my mother\\'s 2_l._,\\nthat you may try your luck. We did not begin reading till Bentley Green.\\nHenry\\'s approbation is hitherto even equal to my wishes. He says it is\\ndifferent from the other two, but does not appear to think it at all\\ninferior. He has only married Mrs. R.[28] I am afraid he has gone through\\nthe most entertaining part. He took to Lady B. and Mrs. N.[29] most\\nkindly, and gives great praise to the drawing of the characters. He\\nunderstands them all, likes Fanny, and, I think, foresees how it will\\nall be. I finished the \"Heroine\" last night, and was very much amused by\\nit. I wonder James did not like it better. It diverted me exceedingly.\\nWe went to bed at ten. I was very tired, but slept to a miracle, and am\\nlovely to-day, and at present Henry seems to have no complaint. We left\\nCobham at half-past eight, stopped to bait and breakfast at Kingston,\\nand were in this house considerably before two. Nice smiling Mr. Barlowe\\nmet us at the door, and, in reply to inquiries after news, said that\\npeace was generally expected. I have taken possession of my bedroom,\\nunpacked my bandbox, sent Miss P.\\'s two letters to the twopenny post,\\nbeen visited by M^{d.} B., and am now writing by myself at the new table\\nin the front room. It is snowing. We had some snowstorms yesterday, and\\na smart frost at night, which gave us a hard road from Cobham to\\nKingston; but as it was then getting dirty and heavy, Henry had a pair\\nof leaders put on to the bottom of Sloane St. His own horses, therefore,\\ncannot have had hard work. I watched for veils as we drove through the\\nstreets, and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads. And\\nnow, how do you all do?--you in particular, after the worry of yesterday\\nand the day before. I hope Martha had a pleasant visit again, and that\\nyou and my mother could eat your beef-pudding. Depend upon my thinking\\nof the chimney-sweeper as soon as I wake to-morrow. Places are secured\\nat Drury Lane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean\\nthat only a third and fourth row could be got; as it is in a front box,\\nhowever, I hope we shall do pretty well--Shylock, a good play for\\nFanny--she cannot be much affected, I think. Mrs. Perigord has just been\\nhere. She tells me that we owe her master for the silk-dyeing. My poor\\nold muslin has never been dyed yet. It has been promised to be done\\nseveral times. What wicked people dyers are! They begin with dipping\\ntheir own souls in scarlet sin. It is evening. We have drank tea, and I\\nhave torn through the third vol. of the \"Heroine.\" I do not think it\\nfalls off. It is a delightful burlesque, particularly on the Radcliffe\\nstyle. Henry is going on with \"Mansfield Park.\" He admires H. Crawford:\\nI mean properly, as a clever, pleasant man. I tell you all the good I\\ncan, as I know how much you will enjoy it. We hear that Mr. Kean is more\\nadmired than ever. There are no good places to be got in Drury Lane for\\nthe next fortnight, but Henry means to secure some for Saturday\\nfortnight, when you are reckoned upon. Give my love to little Cass. I\\nhope she found my bed comfortable last night. I have seen nobody in\\nLondon yet with such a long chin as Dr. Syntax, nor anybody quite so\\nlarge as Gogmagolicus.\\n\\n                                    Yours aff^{ly},       J.

       " '                                  HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (March 9).\\n\\nWELL, we went to the play again last night, and as we were out a great\\npart of the morning too, shopping, and seeing the Indian jugglers, I am\\nvery glad to be quiet now till dressing-time. We are to dine at the\\nTilsons\\', and to-morrow at Mr. Spencer\\'s.\\n\\nWe had not done breakfast yesterday when Mr. J. Plumptre appeared to say\\nthat he had secured a box. Henry asked him to dine here, which I fancy\\nhe was very happy to do, and so at five o\\'clock we four sat down to\\ntable together, while the master of the house was preparing for going\\nout himself. The \"Farmer\\'s Wife\" is a musical thing in three acts, and\\nas Edward was steady in not staying for anything more, we were at home\\nbefore ten.\\n\\nFanny and Mr. J. P. are delighted with Miss S., and her merit in singing\\nis, I dare say, very great; that she gave me no pleasure is no\\nreflection upon her, nor, I hope, upon myself, being what Nature made me\\non that article. All that I am sensible of in Miss S. is a pleasing\\nperson and no skill in acting. We had Mathews, Liston, and Emery; of\\ncourse, some amusement.\\n\\nOur friends were off before half-past eight this morning, and had the\\nprospect of a heavy cold journey before them. I think they both liked\\ntheir visit very much. I am sure Fanny did. Henry sees decided\\nattachment between her and his new acquaintance.\\n\\nI have a cold, too, as well as my mother and Martha. Let it be a\\ngenerous emulation between us which can get rid of it first.\\n\\nI wear my gauze gown to-day, long sleeves and all. I shall see how they\\nsucceed, but as yet I have no reason to suppose long sleeves are\\nallowable.

Well, you had a good journey, I trust, and all that, and not rain\\nenough to spoil your bonnet. It appeared so likely to be a wet evening\\nthat I went up to the Gt. House between three and four, and dawdled away\\nan hour very comfortably, though Edwd. was not very brisk. The air was\\nclearer in the evening, and he was better. We all five walked together\\ninto the kitchen garden and along the Gosport road, and they drank tea\\nwith us.\\n\\nYou will be glad to hear that G. Turner has another situation, something\\nin the cow line, near Rumsey, and he wishes to move immediately, which\\nis not likely to be inconvenient to anybody.\\n\\nThe new nurseryman at Alton comes this morning to value the crops in the\\ngarden.\\n\\nThe only letter to-day is from Mrs. Cooke to me. They do not leave home\\ntill July, and want me to come to them, according to my promise. And,\\nafter considering everything, I have resolved on going. My companions\\npromote it. I will not go, however, till after Edward is gone, that he\\nmay feel he has a somebody to give memorandums to, to the last. I must\\ngive up all help from his carriage, of course. And, at any rate, it must\\nbe such an excess of expense that I have quite made up my mind to it,\\nand do not mean to care.\\n\\nI have been thinking of Triggs and the chair, you may be sure, but I\\nknow it will end in posting. They will meet me at Guildford.\\n\\nIn addition to their standing claims on me they admire \"Mansfield Park\"\\nexceedingly. Mr. Cooke says \"it is the most sensible novel he ever\\nread,\" and the manner in which I treat the clergy delights them very\\nmuch. Altogether, I must go, and I want you to join me there when your\\nvisit in Henrietta St. is over. Put this into your capacious head.\\n\\nTake care of yourself, and do not be trampled to death in running after\\nthe Emperor. The report in Alton yesterday was that they would certainly\\ntravel this road either to or from Portsmouth. I long to know what this\\nbow of the Prince\\'s will produce.\\n\\nI saw Mrs. Andrews yesterday. Mrs. Browning had seen her before. She is\\nvery glad to send an Elizabeth.\\n\\nMiss Benn continues the same. Mr. Curtis, however, saw her yesterday,\\nand said her hand was going on as well as possible. Accept our best\\nlove.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                          J.

Your good account of everybody made us very happy.\\n\\nI heard yesterday from Frank. When he began his letter he hoped to be\\nhere on Monday, but before it was ended he had been told that the naval\\nreview would not take place till Friday, which would probably occasion\\nhim some delay, as he cannot get some necessary business of his own\\nattended to while Portsmouth is in such a bustle. I hope Fanny has seen\\nthe Emperor, and then I may fairly wish them all away. I go to-morrow,\\nand hope for some delays and adventures.\\n\\nMy mother's wood is brought in, but, by some mistake, no bavins. She\\nmust therefore buy some.\\n\\nHenry at White's! Oh, what a Henry! I do not know what to wish as to\\nMiss B., so I will hold my tongue and my wishes.\\n\\nSackree and the children set off yesterday, and have not been returned\\nback upon us. They were all very well the evening before. We had\\nhandsome presents from the Gt. House yesterday,--a ham and the four\\nleeches. Sackree has left some shirts of her master's at the school,\\nwhich, finished or unfinished, she begs to have sent by Henry and Wm.\\nMr. Hinton is expected home soon, which is a good thing for the shirts.\\n\\nWe have called upon Miss Dusantoy and Miss Papillon, and been very\\npretty. Miss D. has a great idea of being Fanny Price,--she and her\\nyoungest sister together, who is named Fanny.\\n\\nMiss Benn has drank tea with the Prowtings, and, I believe, comes to us\\nthis evening. She has still a swelling about the forefinger and a little\\ndischarge, and does not seem to be on the point of a perfect cure, but\\nher spirits are good, and she will be most happy, I believe, to accept\\nany invitation. The Clements are gone to Petersfield to look.\\n\\nOnly think of the Marquis of Granby being dead. I hope, if it please\\nHeaven there should be another son, they will have better sponsors and\\nless parade.\\n\\nI certainly do not wish that Henry should think again of getting me to\\ntown. I would rather return straight from Bookham; but if he really does\\npropose it, I cannot say No to what will be so kindly intended. It could\\nbe but for a few days, however, as my mother would be quite disappointed\\nby my exceeding the fortnight which I now talk of as the outside--at\\nleast, we could not both remain longer away comfortably.\\n\\nThe middle of July is Martha's time, as far as she has any time. She has\\nleft it to Mrs. Craven to fix the day. I wish she could get her money\\npaid, for I fear her going at all depends upon that.\\n\\nInstead of Bath the Deans Dundases have taken a house at\\nClifton--Richmond Terrace--and she is as glad of the change as even you\\nand I should be, or almost. She will now be able to go on from Berks and\\nvisit them without any fears from heat.\\n\\nThis post has brought me a letter from Miss Sharpe. Poor thing! she has\\nbeen suffering indeed, but is now in a comparative state of comfort. She\\nis at Sir W. P.'s, in Yorkshire, with the children, and there is no\\nappearance of her quitting them. Of course we lose the pleasure of\\nseeing her here. She writes highly of Sir Wm. I do so want him to marry\\nher. There is a Dow. Lady P. presiding there to make it all right. The\\nMan is the same; but she does not mention what he is by profession or\\ntrade. She does not think Lady P. was privy to his scheme on her, but,\\non being in his power, yielded. Oh, Sir Wm.! Sir Wm.! how I will love\\nyou if you will love Miss Sharpe!\\n\\nMrs. Driver, etc., are off by Collier, but so near being too late that\\nshe had not time to call and leave the keys herself. I have them,\\nhowever. I suppose one is the key of the linen-press, but I do not know\\nwhat to guess the other.\\n\\nThe coach was stopped at the blacksmith's, and they came running down\\nwith Triggs and Browning, and trunks, and birdcages. Quite amusing.\\n\\nMy mother desires her love, and hopes to hear from you.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                       J.

       " '                        23 HANS PLACE, Tuesday morning (August, 1814).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I had a very good journey, not crowded, two of the\\nthree taken up at Bentley being children, the others of a reasonable\\nsize; and they were all very quiet and civil. We were late in London,\\nfrom being a great load, and from changing coaches at Farnham; it was\\nnearly four, I believe, when we reached Sloane Street. Henry himself met\\nme, and as soon as my trunk and basket could be routed out from all the\\nother trunks and baskets in the world, we were on our way to Hans Place\\nin the luxury of a nice, large, cool, dirty hackney coach.\\n\\nThere were four in the kitchen part of Yalden, and I was told fifteen at\\ntop, among them Percy Benn. We met in the same room at Egham, but poor\\nPercy was not in his usual spirits. He would be more chatty, I dare say,\\nin his way from Woolwich. We took up a young Gibson at Holybourn, and,\\nin short, everybody either did come up by Yalden yesterday, or wanted to\\ncome up. It put me in mind of my own coach between Edinburgh and\\nStirling.\\n\\nHenry is very well, and has given me an account of the Canterbury races,\\nwhich seem to have been as pleasant as one could wish. Everything went\\nwell. Fanny had good partners, Mr. ---- was her second on Thursday, but\\nhe did not dance with her any more.\\n\\nThis will content you for the present. I must just add, however, that\\nthere were no Lady Charlottes, they were gone off to Kirby, and that\\nMary Oxenden, instead of dying, is going to marry Wm. Hammond.\\n\\nNo James and Edward yet. Our evening yesterday was perfectly quiet; we\\nonly talked a little to Mr. Tilson across the intermediate gardens; she\\nwas gone out airing with Miss Burdett. It is a delightful place,--more\\nthan answers my expectation. Having got rid of my unreasonable ideas, I\\nfind more space and comfort in the rooms than I had supposed, and the\\ngarden is quite a love. I am in the front attic, which is the bedchamber\\nto be preferred.\\n\\nHenry wants you to see it all, and asked whether you would return with\\nhim from Hampshire; I encouraged him to think you would. He breakfasts\\nhere early, and then rides to Henrietta St. If it continues fine, John\\nis to drive me there by and by, and we shall take an airing together;\\nand I do not mean to take any other exercise, for I feel a little tired\\nafter my long jumble. I live in his room downstairs; it is particularly\\npleasant from opening upon the garden. I go and refresh myself every now\\nand then, and then come back to solitary coolness. There is one\\nmaidservant only, a very creditable, clean-looking young woman. Richard\\nremains for the present.\\n\\n_Wednesday morning._--My brother and Edwd. arrived last night. They\\ncould not get places the day before. Their business is about teeth and\\nwigs, and they are going after breakfast to Scarman\\'s and Tavistock St.,\\nand they are to return to go with me afterwards in the barouche. I hope\\nto do some of my errands to-day.\\n\\nI got the willow yesterday, as Henry was not quite ready when I reached\\nHena. St. I saw Mr. Hampson there for a moment. He dines here to-morrow,\\nand proposed bringing his son; so I must submit to seeing George\\nHampson, though I had hoped to go through life without it. It was one of\\nmy vanities, like your not reading \"Patronage.\"\\n\\nAfter leaving H. St. we drove to Mrs. Latouche\\'s; they are always at\\nhome, and they are to dine here on Friday. We could do no more, as it\\nbegan to rain.\\n\\nWe dine at half-past four to-day, that our visitors may go to the play,\\nand Henry and I are to spend the evening with the Tilsons, to meet Miss\\nBurnett, who leaves town to-morrow. Mrs. T. called on me yesterday.\\n\\nIs not this all that can have happened or been arranged? Not quite.\\nHenry wants me to see more of his Hanwell favorite, and has written to\\ninvite her to spend a day or two here with me. His scheme is to fetch\\nher on Saturday. I am more and more convinced that he will marry again\\nsoon, and like the idea of her better than of anybody else at hand.\\n\\nNow I have breakfasted and have the room to myself again. It is likely\\nto be a fine day. How do you all do?\\n\\nHenry talks of being at Chawton about the 1st of Sept. He has once\\nmentioned a scheme which I should rather like,--calling on the Birches\\nand the Crutchleys in our way. It may never come to anything, but I must\\nprovide for the possibility by troubling you to send up my silk pelisse\\nby Collier on Saturday. I feel it would be necessary on such an\\noccasion; and be so good as to put up a clean dressing-gown which will\\ncome from the wash on Friday. You need not direct it to be left\\nanywhere. It may take its chance.\\n\\nWe are to call for Henry between three and four, and I must finish this\\nand carry it with me, as he is not always there in the morning before\\nthe parcel is made up. And before I set off, I must return Mrs. Tilson\\'s\\nvisit. I hear nothing of the Hoblyns, and abstain from all inquiry.\\n\\nI hope Mary Jane and Frank\\'s gardens go on well. Give my love to them\\nall--Nunna Hat\\'s love to George. A great many people wanted to run up in\\nthe Poach as well as me. The wheat looked very well all the way, and\\nJames says the same of _his_ road.\\n\\nThe same good account of Mrs. C.\\'s health continues, and her\\ncircumstances mend. She gets farther and farther from poverty. What a\\ncomfort! Good-by to you.\\n\\n                      Yours very truly and affectionately,\\n                                                        JANE.\\n\\nAll well at Steventon.

I read it aloud to your\\ngrandmamma and Aunt Cass, and we were all very much pleased. The spirit\\ndoes not droop at all. Sir Thos., Lady Helen, and St. Julian are very\\nwell done, and Cecilia continues to be interesting in spite of her being\\nso amiable. It was very fit you should advance her age. I like the\\nbeginning of Devereux Forester very much, a great deal better than if he\\nhad been very good or very bad. A few verbal corrections are all that I\\nfelt tempted to make; the principal of them is a speech of St. Julian to\\nLady Helen, which you see I have presumed to alter. As Lady H. is\\nCecilia's superior, it would not be correct to talk of her being\\nintroduced. It is Cecilia who must be introduced. And I do not like a\\nlover speaking in the 3rd person; it is too much like the part of Lord\\nOvertley, and I think it not natural. If you think differently, however,\\nyou need not mind me. I am impatient for more, and only wait for a safe\\nconveyance to return this.\\n\\n                                      Yours affectionately,\\n                                                         J.

I kept it on purpose to refer\\nto it at a proper time, and then forgot it. I like the name \"Which is\\nthe Heroine\" very well, and I dare say shall grow to like it very much\\nin time; but \"Enthusiasm\" was something so very superior that my common\\ntitle must appear to disadvantage. I am not sensible of any blunders\\nabout Dawlish; the library was pitiful and wretched twelve years ago,\\nand not likely to have anybody\\'s publications. There is no such title as\\nDesborough, either among dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, or barons.\\nThese were your inquiries. I will now thank you for your envelope\\nreceived this morning. Your Aunt Cass is as well pleased with St. Julian\\nas ever, and I am delighted with the idea of seeing Progillian again.\\n\\n_Wednesday_, 17.--We have now just finished the first of the three books\\nI had the pleasure of receiving yesterday. I read it aloud, and we are\\nall very much amused, and like the work quite as well as ever. I depend\\non getting through another book before dinner, but there is really a\\ngood deal of respectable reading in your forty-eight pages. I have no\\ndoubt six would make a very good-sized volume. You must have been quite\\npleased to have accomplished so much. I like Lord Portman and his\\nbrother very much. I am only afraid that Lord P.\\'s good nature will make\\nmost people like him better than he deserves. The whole family are very\\ngood; and Lady Anne, who was your great dread, you have succeeded\\nparticularly well with. Bell Griffin is just what she should be. My\\ncorrections have not been more important than before; here and there we\\nhave thought the sense could be expressed in fewer words, and I have\\nscratched out Sir Thos. from walking with the others to the stables,\\netc. the very day after breaking his arm; for though I find your papa\\ndid walk out immediately after his arm was set, I think it can be so\\nlittle usual as to appear unnatural in a book. Lynn will not do. Lynn is\\ntowards forty miles from Dawlish and would not be talked of there. I\\nhave put Starcross instead. If you prefer Easton, that must be always\\nsafe.\\n\\nI have also scratched out the introduction between Lord Portman and his\\nbrother and Mr. Griffin. A country surgeon (don\\'t tell Mr. C. Lyford)\\nwould not be introduced to men of their rank; and when Mr. P. is first\\nbrought in, he would not be introduced as the Honorable. That\\ndistinction is never mentioned at such times; at least, I believe not.\\nNow we have finished the second book, or rather the fifth. I do think\\nyou had better omit Lady Helena\\'s postscript. To those that are\\nacquainted with \"Pride and Prejudice\" it will seem an imitation. And\\nyour Aunt C. and I both recommend your making a little alteration in the\\nlast scene between Devereux F. and Lady Clanmurray and her daughter. We\\nthink they press him too much, more than sensible or well-bred women\\nwould do; Lady C., at least, should have discretion enough to be sooner\\nsatisfied with his determination of not going with them. I am very much\\npleased with Egerton as yet. I did not expect to like him, but I do, and\\nSusan is a very nice little animated creature; but St. Julian is the\\ndelight of our lives. He is quite interesting. The whole of his\\nbreak-off with Lady Helena is very well done. Yes; Russell Square is a\\nvery proper distance from Berkeley Square. We are reading the last book.\\nThey must be two days going from Dawlish to Bath. They are nearly one\\nhundred miles apart.\\n\\n_Thursday._--We finished it last night after our return from drinking\\ntea at the Great House. The last chapter does not please us quite so\\nwell; we do not thoroughly like the play, perhaps from having had too\\nmuch of plays in that way lately (_vide_ \"Mansfield Park\"), and we think\\nyou had better not leave England. Let the Portmans go to Ireland; but as\\nyou know nothing of the manners there, you had better not go with them.\\nYou will be in danger of giving false representations. Stick to Bath and\\nthe Foresters. There you will be quite at home.\\n\\nYour Aunt C. does not like desultory novels, and is rather afraid yours\\nwill be too much so, that there will be too frequently a change from one\\nset of people to another, and that circumstances will be introduced of\\napparent consequence which will lead to nothing. It will not be so great\\nan objection to me if it does. I allow much more latitude than she does,\\nand think Nature and spirit cover many sins of a wandering story, and\\npeople in general do not care so much about it for your comfort.\\n\\nI should like to have had more of Devereux. I do not feel enough\\nacquainted with him. You were afraid of meddling with him, I dare say. I\\nlike your sketch of Lord Clanmurray, and your picture of the two young\\ngirls\\' enjoyment is very good. I have not noticed St. Julian\\'s serious\\nconversation with Cecilia, but I like it exceedingly. What he says about\\nthe madness of otherwise sensible women on the subject of their\\ndaughters coming out is worth its weight in gold.\\n\\nI do not perceive that the language sinks.

We are not\\nsatisfied with Mrs. Forester settling herself as tenant and near\\nneighbor to such a man as Sir Thomas, without having some other\\ninducement to go there. She ought to have some friend living thereabouts\\nto tempt her. A woman going with two girls just growing up into a\\nneighborhood where she knows nobody but one man of not very good\\ncharacter, is an awkwardness which so prudent a woman as Mrs. F. would\\nnot be likely to fall into. Remember she is very prudent. You must not\\nlet her act inconsistently. Give her a friend, and let that friend be\\ninvited by Sir Thomas H. to meet her, and we shall have no objection to\\nher dining at the Priory as she does; but otherwise a woman in her\\nsituation would hardly go there before she had been visited by other\\nfamilies. I like the scene itself, the Miss Leslie, Lady Anne, and the\\nmusic very much. Leslie is a noble name. Sir Thomas H. you always do\\nvery well. I have only taken the liberty of expunging one phrase of his\\nwhich would not be allowable,--\"Bless my heart!\" It is too familiar and\\ninelegant. Your grandmother is more disturbed at Mrs. Forester\\'s not\\nreturning the Egertons\\' visit sooner than by anything else. They ought\\nto have called at the Parsonage before Sunday. You describe a sweet\\nplace, but your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked.\\nYou give too many particulars of right hand and left. Mrs. Forester is\\nnot careful enough of Susan\\'s health. Susan ought not to be walking out\\nso soon after heavy rains, taking long walks in the dirt. An anxious\\nmother would not suffer it. I like your Susan very much; she is a sweet\\ncreature, her playfulness of fancy is very delightful. I like her as she\\nis now exceedingly, but I am not quite so well satisfied with her\\nbehavior to George R. At first she seems all over attachment and\\nfeeling, and afterwards to have none at all; she is so extremely\\nconfused at the ball, and so well satisfied apparently with Mr. Morgan.\\nShe seems to have changed her character.\\n\\nYou are now collecting your people delightfully, getting them exactly\\ninto such a spot as is the delight of my life. Three or four families in\\na country village is the very thing to work on, and I hope you will do a\\ngreat deal more, and make full use of them while they are so very\\nfavorably arranged.\\n\\nYou are but now coming to the heart and beauty of your story. Until the\\nheroine grows up the fun must be imperfect, but I expect a great deal of\\nentertainment from the next three or four books, and I hope you will not\\nresent these remarks by sending me no more. We like the Egertons very\\nwell. We see no blue pantaloons or cocks or hens. There is nothing to\\nenchant one certainly in Mr. L. L., but we make no objection to him, and\\nhis inclination to like Susan is pleasing. The sister is a good\\ncontrast, but the name of Rachel is as much as I can bear. They are not\\nso much like the Papillons as I expected. Your last chapter is very\\nentertaining, the conversation on genius, etc.; Mr. St. Julian and Susan\\nboth talk in character, and very well. In some former parts Cecilia is\\nperhaps a little too solemn and good, but upon the whole her disposition\\nis very well opposed to Susan\\'s, her want of imagination is very\\nnatural. I wish you could make Mrs. Forester talk more; but she must be\\ndifficult to manage and make entertaining, because there is so much good\\nsense and propriety about her that nothing can be made very broad. Her\\neconomy and her ambition must not be staring. The papers left by Mrs.\\nFisher are very good. Of course one guesses something. I hope when you\\nhave written a great deal more, you will be equal to scratching out some\\nof the past. The scene with Mrs. Mellish I should condemn; it is prosy\\nand nothing to the purpose, and indeed the more you can find in your\\nheart to curtail between Dawlish and Newton Priors, the better I think\\nit will be,--one does not care for girls until they are grown up. Your\\nAunt C. quite understands the exquisiteness of that name,--Newton Priors\\nis really a nonpareil. Milton would have given his eyes to have thought\\nof it. Is not the cottage taken from Tollard Royal?\\n\\n[Thus far the letter was written on the 9th, but before it was finished\\nnews arrived at Chawton of the death of Mrs. Charles Austen. She died in\\nher confinement, and the baby died also. She left three little\\ngirls,--Cassie, Harriet, and Fanny.

I like Susan as well as\\never, and begin now not to care at all about Cecilia; she may stay at\\nEaston Court as long as she likes. Henry Mellish will be, I am afraid,\\ntoo much in the common novel style,--a handsome, amiable,\\nunexceptionable young man (such as do not much abound in real life),\\ndesperately in love and all in vain. But I have no business to judge him\\nso early Jane Egerton is a very natural, comprehensible girl, and the\\nwhole of her acquaintance with Susan and Susan\\'s letter to Cecilia are\\nvery pleasing and quite in character. But Miss Egerton does not entirely\\nsatisfy us. She is too formal and solemn, we think, in her advice to her\\nbrother not to fall in love; and it is hardly like a sensible woman,--it\\nis putting it into his head. We should like a few hints from her better.\\nWe feel really obliged to you for introducing a Lady Kenrick; it will\\nremove the greatest fault in the work, and I give you credit for\\nconsiderable forbearance as an author in adopting so much of our\\nopinion. I expect high fun about Mrs. Fisher and Sir Thomas. You have\\nbeen perfectly right in telling Ben. Lefroy of your work, and I am very\\nglad to hear how much he likes it. His encouragement and approbation\\nmust be \"quite beyond everything.\"[33] I do not at all wonder at his not\\nexpecting to like anybody so well as Cecilia at first, but I shall be\\nsurprised if he does not become a Susanite in time. Devereux Forester\\'s\\nbeing ruined by his vanity is extremely good, but I wish you would not\\nlet him plunge into a \"vortex of dissipation.\" I do not object to the\\nthing, but I cannot bear the expression; it is such thorough novel\\nslang, and so old that I dare say Adam met with it in the first novel\\nhe opened. Indeed, I did very much like to know Ben\\'s opinion. I hope he\\nwill continue to be pleased with it, and I think he must, but I cannot\\nflatter him with there being much incident. We have no great right to\\nwonder at his not valuing the name of Progillian. That is a source of\\ndelight which even he can hardly be quite competent to.\\n\\nWalter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. It\\nis not fair. He has fame and profit enough as a poet, and should not be\\ntaking the bread out of the mouths of other people.\\n\\nI do not like him, and do not mean to like \"Waverley\" if I can help it,\\nbut fear I must.\\n\\nI am quite determined, however, not to be pleased with Mrs. West\\'s\\n\"Alicia De Lacy,\" should I ever meet with it, which I hope I shall not.\\nI think I can be stout against anything written by Mrs. West. I have\\nmade up my mind to like no novels really but Miss Edgeworth\\'s, yours,\\nand my own.\\n\\nWhat can you do with Egerton to increase the interest for him? I wish\\nyou could contrive something, some family occurrence to bring out his\\ngood qualities more. Some distress among brothers and sisters to relieve\\nby the sale of his curacy! Something to carry him mysteriously away, and\\nthen be heard of at York or Edinburgh in an old greatcoat. I would not\\nseriously recommend anything improbable, but if you could invent\\nsomething spirited for him, it would have a good effect. He might lend\\nall his money to Captain Morris, but then he would be a great fool if he\\ndid. Cannot the Morrises quarrel and he reconcile them? Excuse the\\nliberty I take in these suggestions.\\n\\nYour Aunt Frank\\'s nursemaid has just given her warning, but whether she\\nis worth your having, or would take your place, I know not. She was Mrs.\\nWebb\\'s maid before she went to the Great House. She leaves your aunt\\nbecause she cannot agree with the other servants. She is in love with\\nthe man, and her head seems rather turned. He returns her affection, but\\nshe fancies every one else is wanting him and envying her. Her previous\\nservice must have fitted her for such a place as yours, and she is very\\nactive and cleanly. The Webbs are really gone! When I saw the wagons at\\nthe door, and thought of all the trouble they must have in moving, I\\nbegan to reproach myself for not having liked them better; but since the\\nwagons have disappeared my conscience has been closed again, and I am\\nexcessively glad they are gone.\\n\\nI am very fond of Sherlock\\'s sermons, and prefer them to almost any.\\n\\n                           Your affectionate aunt,        J.

I shall do very little more, I dare\\nsay, than say over again what you have said before.\\n\\nI was certainly a good deal surprised at first, as I had no suspicion of\\nany change in your feelings, and I have no scruple in saying that you\\ncannot be in love. My dear Fanny, I am ready to laugh at the idea, and\\nyet it is no laughing matter to have had you so mistaken as to your own\\nfeelings. And with all my heart I wish I had cautioned you on that point\\nwhen first you spoke to me; but though I did not think you then much in\\nlove, I did consider you as being attached in a degree quite\\nsufficiently for happiness, as I had no doubt it would increase with\\nopportunity, and from the time of our being in London together I thought\\nyou really very much in love. But you certainly are not at all--there is\\nno concealing it.\\n\\nWhat strange creatures we are! It seems as if your being secure of him\\nhad made you indifferent. There was a little disgust, I suspect, at the\\nraces, and I do not wonder at it. His expressions then would not do for\\none who had rather more acuteness, penetration, and taste, than love,\\nwhich was your case. And yet, after all, I am surprised that the change\\nin your feelings should be so great. He is just what he ever was, only\\nmore evidently and uniformly devoted to you. This is all the difference.\\nHow shall we account for it?\\n\\nMy dearest Fanny, I am writing what will not be of the smallest use to\\nyou. I am feeling differently every moment, and shall not be able to\\nsuggest a single thing that can assist your mind. I could lament in one\\nsentence and laugh in the next, but as to opinion or counsel I am sure\\nthat none will be extracted worth having from this letter.\\n\\nI read yours through the very evening I received it, getting away by\\nmyself. I could not bear to leave off when I had once begun. I was full\\nof curiosity and concern. Luckily your At. C. dined at the other house;\\ntherefore I had not to manoeuvre away from her, and as to anybody else,\\nI do not care.\\n\\nPoor dear Mr. A.! Oh, dear Fanny! your mistake has been one that\\nthousands of women fall into. He was the first young man who attached\\nhimself to you. That was the charm, and most powerful it is. Among the\\nmultitudes, however, that make the same mistake with yourself, there can\\nbe few indeed who have so little reason to regret it; his character and\\nhis attachment leave you nothing to be ashamed of.\\n\\nUpon the whole, what is to be done? You have no inclination for any\\nother person. His situation in life, family, friends, and, above all,\\nhis character, his uncommonly amiable mind, strict principles, just\\nnotions, good habits, all that you know so well how to value, all that\\nis really of the first importance,--everything of this nature pleads his\\ncause most strongly. You have no doubt of his having superior abilities,\\nhe has proved it at the University; he is, I dare say, such a scholar as\\nyour agreeable, idle brothers would ill bear a comparison with.\\n\\nOh, my dear Fanny! the more I write about him the warmer my feelings\\nbecome,--the more strongly I feel the sterling worth of such a young\\nman, and the desirableness of your growing in love with him again. I\\nrecommend this most thoroughly. There are such beings in the world,\\nperhaps one in a thousand, as the creature you and I should think\\nperfection, where grace and spirit are united to worth, where the\\nmanners are equal to the heart and understanding; but such a person may\\nnot come in your way, or, if he does, he may not be the eldest son of a\\nman of fortune, the near relation of your particular friend, and\\nbelonging to your own county.\\n\\nThink of all this, Fanny. Mr. A. has advantages which we do not often\\nmeet in one person. His only fault, indeed, seems modesty. If he were\\nless modest, he would be more agreeable, speak louder, and look\\nimpudenter; and is not it a fine character of which modesty is the only\\ndefect? I have no doubt he will get more lively and more like yourselves\\nas he is more with you; he will catch your ways if he belongs to you.\\nAnd as to there being any objection from his goodness, from the danger\\nof his becoming even evangelical, I cannot admit that. I am by no means\\nconvinced that we ought not all to be evangelicals, and am at least\\npersuaded that they who are so from reason and feeling must be happiest\\nand safest. Do not be frightened from the connection by your brothers\\nhaving most wit,--wisdom is better than wit, and in the long run will\\ncertainly have the laugh on her side; and don\\'t be frightened by the\\nidea of his acting more strictly up to the precepts of the New Testament\\nthan others.\\n\\nAnd now, my dear Fanny, having written so much on one side of the\\nquestion, I shall turn round and entreat you not to commit yourself\\nfarther, and not to think of accepting him unless you really do like\\nhim. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying\\nwithout affection; and if his deficiencies of manner, etc., etc.,\\nstrike you more than all his good qualities, if you continue to think\\nstrongly of them, give him up at once. Things are now in such a state\\nthat you must resolve upon one or the other,--either to allow him to go\\non as he has done, or whenever you are together behave with a coldness\\nwhich may convince him that he has been deceiving himself. I have no\\ndoubt of his suffering a good deal for a time,--a great deal when he\\nfeels that he must give you up; but it is no creed of mine, as you must\\nbe well aware, that such sort of disappointments kill anybody.\\n\\nYour sending the music was an admirable device, it made everything easy,\\nand I do not know how I could have accounted for the parcel otherwise;\\nfor though your dear papa most conscientiously hunted about till he\\nfound me alone in the dining-parlor, your Aunt C. had seen that he had a\\nparcel to deliver. As it was, however, I do not think anything was\\nsuspected.\\n\\nWe have heard nothing fresh from Anna. I trust she is very comfortable\\nin her new home. Her letters have been very sensible and satisfactory,\\nwith no parade of happiness, which I liked them the better for. I have\\noften known young married women write in a way I did not like in that\\nrespect.\\n\\nYou will be glad to hear that the first edition of M. P.[34] is all\\nsold. Your Uncle Henry is rather wanting me to come to town to settle\\nabout a second edition; but as I could not very conveniently leave home\\nnow, I have written him my will and pleasure and unless he still urges\\nit, shall not go. I am very greedy and want to make the most of it; but\\nas you are much above caring about money, I shall not plague you with\\nany particulars. The pleasures of vanity are more within your\\ncomprehension, and you will enter into mine at receiving the praise\\nwhich every now and then comes to me through some channel or other.\\n\\n_Saturday._--Mr. Palmer spent yesterday with us, and is gone off with\\nCassy this morning. We have been expecting Miss Lloyd the last two days,\\nand feel sure of her to-day. Mr. Knight and Mr. Edwd. Knight are to dine\\nwith us, and on Monday they are to dine with us again, accompanied by\\ntheir respectable host and hostess.\\n\\n_Sunday._--Your papa had given me messages to you; but they are\\nunnecessary, as he writes by this post to Aunt Louisa. We had a pleasant\\nparty yesterday; at least we found it so. It is delightful to see him so\\ncheerful and confident.

I read it immediately and with great pleasure. I think you\\nare going on very well. The description of Dr. Griffin and Lady Helena's\\nunhappiness is very good, and just what was likely to be. I am curious\\nto know what the end of them will be. The name of Newton Priors is\\nreally invaluable; I never met with anything superior to it. It is\\ndelightful, and one could live on the name of Newton Priors for a\\ntwelvemonth. Indeed, I think you get on very fast. I only wish other\\npeople of my acquaintance could compose as rapidly. I am pleased with\\nthe dog scene and with the whole of George and Susan's love, but am more\\nparticularly struck with your serious conversations. They are very good\\nthroughout. St. Julian's history was quite a surprise to me. You had not\\nvery long known it yourself, I suspect; but I have no objection to make\\nto the circumstance, and it is very well told. His having been in love\\nwith the aunt gives Cecilia an additional interest with him. I like the\\nidea,--a very proper compliment to an aunt! I rather imagine indeed that\\nnieces are seldom chosen but out of compliment to some aunt or another.\\nI dare say Ben was in love with me once, and would never have thought of\\nyou if he had not supposed me dead of scarlet fever. Yes, I was in a\\nmistake as to the number of books. I thought I had read three before the\\nthree at Chawton, but fewer than six will not do. I want to see dear\\nBell Griffin again; and had you not better give some hint of St.\\nJulian's early history in the beginning of the story?\\n\\nWe shall see nothing of Streatham while we are in town, as Mrs. Hill is\\nto lie in of a daughter. Mrs. Blackstone is to be with her. Mrs.\\nHeathcote and Miss Bigg[35] are just leaving.

I certainly could describe her bedroom and her drawers\\nand her closet better than he can, but I do not feel that I can stop to\\ndo it. I was rather sorry to hear that she is to have an instrument; it\\nseems throwing money away. They will wish the twenty-four guineas in the\\nshape of sheets and towels six months hence; and as to her playing, it\\nnever can be anything.\\n\\nHer purple pelisse rather surprised me. I thought we had known all\\nparaphernalia of that sort. I do not mean to blame her; it looked very\\nwell, and I dare say she wanted it. I suspect nothing worse than its\\nbeing got in secret, and not owned to anybody. I received a very kind\\nnote from her yesterday, to ask me to come again and stay a night with\\nthem. I cannot do it, but I was pleased to find that she had the power\\nof doing so right a thing. My going was to give them both pleasure very\\nproperly.\\n\\nI just saw Mr. Hayter at the play, and think his face would please me on\\nacquaintance. I was sorry he did not dine here. It seemed rather odd to\\nme to be in the theatre with nobody to watch for. I was quite composed\\nmyself, at leisure for all the agitated Isabella could raise.\\n\\nNow, my dearest Fanny, I will begin a subject which comes in very\\nnaturally. You frighten me out of my wits by your reference. Your\\naffection gives me the highest pleasure, but indeed you must not let\\nanything depend on my opinion; your own feelings, and none but your own,\\nshould determine such an important point. So far, however, as answering\\nyour question, I have no scruple. I am perfectly convinced that your\\npresent feelings, supposing that you were to marry now, would be\\nsufficient for his happiness; but when I think how very, very far it is\\nfrom a \"now,\" and take everything that may be into consideration, I dare\\nnot say, \"Determine to accept him;\" the risk is too great for you,\\nunless your own sentiments prompt it.\\n\\nYou will think me perverse, perhaps; in my last letter I was urging\\neverything in his favor, and now I am inclining the other way, but I\\ncannot help it; I am at present more impressed with the possible evil\\nthat may arise to you from engaging yourself to him--in word or\\nmind--than with anything else. When I consider how few young men you\\nhave yet seen much of, how capable you are (yes, I do still think you\\nvery capable) of being really in love, and how full of temptation the\\nnext six or seven years of your life will probably be (it is the very\\nperiod of life for the strongest attachments to be formed),--I cannot\\nwish you, with your present very cool feelings, to devote yourself in\\nhonor to him. It is very true that you never may attach another man his\\nequal altogether; but if that other man has the power of attaching you\\nmore, he will be in your eyes the most perfect.\\n\\nI shall be glad if you can revive past feelings, and from your unbiassed\\nself resolve to go on as you have done, but this I do not expect; and\\nwithout it I cannot wish you to be fettered. I should not be afraid of\\nyour marrying him; with all his worth you would soon love him enough for\\nthe happiness of both; but I should dread the continuance of this sort\\nof tacit engagement, with such an uncertainty as there is of when it may\\nbe completed. Years may pass before he is independent; you like him well\\nenough to marry, but not well enough to wait; the unpleasantness of\\nappearing fickle is certainly great; but if you think you want\\npunishment for past illusions, there it is, and nothing can be compared\\nto the misery of being bound without love,--bound to one, and preferring\\nanother; that is a punishment which you do not deserve.\\n\\nI know you did not meet, or rather will not meet, to-day, as he called\\nhere yesterday; and I am glad of it. It does not seem very likely, at\\nleast, that he should be in time for a dinner visit sixty miles off. We\\ndid not see him, only found his card when we came home at four. Your\\nUncle H. merely observed that he was a day after \"the fair.\" We asked\\nyour brother on Monday (when Mr. Hayter was talked of) why he did not\\ninvite him too; saying, \"I know he is in town, for I met him the other\\nday in Bond St.\" Edward answered that he did not know where he was to be\\nfound. \"Don\\'t you know his chambers?\" \"No.\"\\n\\nI shall be most glad to hear from you again, my dearest Fanny, but it\\nmust not be later than Saturday, as we shall be off on Monday long\\nbefore the letters are delivered; and write something that may do to be\\nread or told. I am to take the Miss Moores back on Saturday, and when I\\nreturn I shall hope to find your pleasant little flowing scrawl on the\\ntable. It will be a relief to me after playing at ma\\'ams, for though I\\nlike Miss H. M. as much as one can at my time of life after a day\\'s\\nacquaintance, it is uphill work to be talking to those whom one knows so\\nlittle.\\n\\nOnly one comes back with me to-morrow, probably Miss Eliza, and I rather\\ndread it. We shall not have two ideas in common. She is young, pretty,\\nchattering, and thinking chiefly, I presume, of dress, company, and\\nadmiration. Mr. Sanford is to join us at dinner, which will be a\\ncomfort, and in the evening, while your uncle and Miss Eliza play chess,\\nhe shall tell me comical things and I will laugh at them, which will be\\na pleasure to both.\\n\\nI called in Keppel Street and saw them all, including dear Uncle\\nCharles, who is to come and dine with us quietly to-day. Little Harriot\\nsat in my lap, and seemed as gentle and affectionate as ever, and as\\npretty, except not being quite well. Fanny is a fine stout girl, talking\\nincessantly, with an interesting degree of lisp and indistinctness, and\\nvery likely may be the handsomest in time. Cassy did not show more\\npleasure in seeing me than her sisters, but I expected no better. She\\ndoes not shine in the tender feelings. She will never be a Miss O\\'Neil,\\nmore in the Mrs. Siddons line.\\n\\nThank you, but it is not settled yet whether I do hazard a second\\nedition. We are to see Egerton to-day, when it will probably be\\ndetermined. People are more ready to borrow and praise than to buy,\\nwhich I cannot wonder at; but though I like praise as well as anybody, I\\nlike what Edward calls \"Pewter\" too. I hope he continues careful of his\\neyes, and finds the good effect of it. I cannot suppose we differ in our\\nideas of the Christian religion. You have given an excellent description\\nof it.

       " '                                  HANS PLACE, Friday (Nov. 24, 1815).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I have the pleasure of sending you a much better\\naccount of my affairs, which I know will be a great delight to you.\\n\\nI wrote to Mr. Murray yesterday myself, and Henry wrote at the same time\\nto Roworth. Before the notes were out of the house, I received three\\nsheets and an apology from R. We sent the notes, however, and I had a\\nmost civil one in reply from Mr. M. He is so very polite, indeed, that\\nit is quite overcoming. The printers have been waiting for paper,--the\\nblame is thrown upon the stationer; but he gives his word that I shall\\nhave no further cause for dissatisfaction. He has lent us Miss Williams\\nand Scott, and says that any book of his will always be at my service.\\nIn short, I am soothed and complimented into tolerable comfort.\\n\\nWe had a visit yesterday from Edwd. Knight, and Mr. Mascall joined him\\nhere; and this morning has brought Mr. Mascall\\'s compliments and two\\npheasants. We have some hope of Edward\\'s coming to dinner to-day; he\\nwill, if he can, I believe. He is looking extremely well.\\n\\nTo-morrow Mr. Haden is to dine with us. There is happiness! We really\\ngrow so fond of Mr. Haden that I do not know what to expect. He and Mr.\\nTilson and Mr. Philips made up our circle of wits last night. Fanny\\nplayed, and he sat and listened and suggested improvements, till Richard\\ncame in to tell him that \"the doctor was waiting for him at Captn.\\nBlake\\'s;\" and then he was off with a speed that you can imagine. He\\nnever does appear in the least above his profession or out of humor\\nwith it, or I should think poor Captn. Blake, whoever he is, in a very\\nbad way.\\n\\nI must have misunderstood Henry when I told you that you were to hear\\nfrom him to-day. He read me what he wrote to Edward: part of it must\\nhave amused him, I am sure one part, alas! cannot be very amusing to\\nanybody. I wonder that with such business to worry him he can be getting\\nbetter; but he certainly does gain strength, and if you and Edwd. were\\nto see him now, I feel sure that you would think him improved since\\nMonday.\\n\\nHe was out yesterday; it was a fine sunshiny day here (in the country\\nperhaps you might have clouds and fogs. Dare I say so? I shall not\\ndeceive you, if I do, as to my estimation of the climate of London), and\\nhe ventured first on the balcony and then as far as the greenhouse. He\\ncaught no cold, and therefore has done more to-day, with great delight\\nand self-persuasion of improvement.\\n\\nHe has been to see Mrs. Tilson and the Malings. By the by, you may talk\\nto Mr. T. of his wife\\'s being better; I saw her yesterday, and was\\nsensible of her having gained ground in the last two days.\\n\\n_Evening._--We have had no Edward. Our circle is formed,--only Mr.\\nTilson and Mr. Haden. We are not so happy as we were. A message came\\nthis afternoon from Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, offering themselves to\\ndrink tea with us to-morrow, and, as it was accepted, here is an end of\\nour extreme felicity in our dinner guest. I am heartily sorry they are\\ncoming; it will be an evening spoilt to Fanny and me.\\n\\nAnother little disappointment: Mr. H. advises Henry\\'s not venturing with\\nus in the carriage to-morrow; if it were spring, he says, it would be a\\ndifferent thing. One would rather this had not been. He seems to think\\nhis going out to-day rather imprudent, though acknowledging at the same\\ntime that he is better than he was in the morning.\\n\\nFanny has had a letter full of commissions from Goodnestone; we shall be\\nbusy about them and her own matters, I dare say, from twelve to four.\\nNothing, I trust, will keep us from Keppel Street.\\n\\nThis day has brought a most friendly letter from Mr. Fowle, with a brace\\nof pheasants. I did not know before that Henry had written to him a few\\ndays ago to ask for them. We shall live upon pheasants,--no bad life!\\n\\nI send you five one-pound notes, for fear you should be distressed for\\nlittle money. Lizzy\\'s work is charmingly done; shall you put it to your\\nchintz? A sheet came in this moment; 1st and 3rd vols. are now at 144;\\n2nd at 48. I am sure you will like particulars. We are not to have the\\ntrouble of returning the sheets to Mr. Murray any longer; the printer\\'s\\nboys bring and carry.\\n\\nI hope Mary continues to get well fast, and I send my love to little\\nHerbert. You will tell me more of Martha\\'s plans, of course, when you\\nwrite again. Remember me most kindly to everybody, and Miss Benn\\nbesides.\\n\\n                            Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                   J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nI have been listening to dreadful insanity. It is Mr. Haden\\'s firm\\nbelief that a person not musical is fit for every sort of wickedness. I\\nventured to assert a little on the other side, but wished the cause in\\nabler hands.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It cost 2_s._ 10_d._, but as there is a certain saving of\\n2_s._ 4½_d._ on the other side, I am sure it is well worth doing. I send\\nfour pair of silk stockings, but I do not want them washed at present.\\nIn the three neckhandkerchiefs I include the one sent down before. These\\nthings, perhaps, Edwd. may be able to bring, but even if he is not, I am\\nextremely pleased with his returning to you from Steventon. It is much\\nbetter, far preferable.\\n\\nI did mention the P. R. in my note to Mr. Murray; it brought me a fine\\ncompliment in return. Whether it has done any other good I do not know,\\nbut Henry thought it worth trying.\\n\\nThe printers continue to supply me very well. I am advanced in Vol. III.\\nto my _arra_-root, upon which peculiar style of spelling there is a\\nmodest query in the margin. I will not forget Anna\\'s arrowroot. I hope\\nyou have told Martha of my first resolution of letting nobody know that\\nI might dedicate, etc., for fear of being obliged to do it, and that she\\nis thoroughly convinced of my being influenced now by nothing but the\\nmost mercenary motives. I have paid nine shillings on her account to\\nMiss Palmer; there was no more owing.\\n\\nWell, we were very busy all yesterday; from half-past eleven till four\\nin the streets, working almost entirely for other people, driving from\\nplace to place after a parcel for Sandling, which we could never find,\\nand encountering the miseries of Grafton House to get a purple frock for\\nEleanor Bridges. We got to Keppel St., however, which was all I cared\\nfor; and though we could stay only a quarter of an hour, Fanny\\'s calling\\ngave great pleasure, and her sensibility still greater, for she was very\\nmuch affected at the sight of the children. Poor little F. looked\\nheavy. We saw the whole party.\\n\\nAunt Harriet hopes Cassy will not forget to make a pincushion for Mrs.\\nKelly, as she has spoken of its being promised her several times. I hope\\nwe shall see Aunt H. and the dear little girls here on Thursday.\\n\\nSo much for the morning. Then came the dinner and Mr. Haden, who brought\\ngood manners and clever conversation. From seven to eight the harp; at\\neight Mrs. L. and Miss E. arrived, and for the rest of the evening the\\ndrawing-room was thus arranged: on the sofa side the two ladies, Henry,\\nand myself making the best of it; on the opposite side Fanny and Mr.\\nHaden, in two chairs (I believe, at least, they had two chairs), talking\\ntogether uninterruptedly. Fancy the scene! And what is to be fancied\\nnext? Why, that Mr. H. dines here again to-morrow. To-day we are to have\\nMr. Barlow. Mr. H. is reading \"Mansfield Park\" for the first time, and\\nprefers it to P. and P.\\n\\nA hare and four rabbits from Gm. yesterday, so that we are stocked for\\nnearly a week. Poor Farmer Andrews! I am very sorry for him, and\\nsincerely wish his recovery.\\n\\nA better account of the sugar than I could have expected. I should like\\nto help you break some more. I am glad you cannot wake early; I am sure\\nyou must have been under great arrears of rest.\\n\\nFanny and I have been to B. Chapel, and walked back with Maria Cuthbert.\\nWe have been very little plagued with visitors this last week. I\\nremember only Miss Herries, the aunt, but I am in terror for to-day, a\\nfine bright Sunday; plenty of mortar, and nothing to do.\\n\\nHenry gets out in his garden every day, but at present his inclination\\nfor doing more seems over, nor has he now any plan for leaving London\\nbefore Dec. 18, when he thinks of going to Oxford for a few days;\\nto-day, indeed, his feelings are for continuing where he is through the\\nnext two months.\\n\\nOne knows the uncertainty of all this; but should it be so, we must\\nthink the best, and hope the best, and do the best; and my idea in that\\ncase is, that when he goes to Oxford I should go home, and have nearly a\\nweek of you before you take my place. This is only a silent project, you\\nknow, to be gladly given up if better things occur. Henry calls himself\\nstronger every day, and Mr. H. keeps on approving his pulse, which seems\\ngenerally better than ever, but still they will not let him be well.\\nPerhaps when Fanny is gone he will be allowed to recover faster.\\n\\nI am not disappointed: I never thought the little girl at Wyards very\\npretty, but she will have a fine complexion and curly hair, and pass for\\na beauty. We are glad the mamma\\'s cold has not been worse, and send her\\nour love and good wishes by every convenient opportunity. Sweet, amiable\\nFrank! why does he have a cold too? Like Captain Mirvan to Mr. Duval,[36]\\n\"I wish it well over with him.\"\\n\\nFanny has heard all that I have said to you about herself and Mr. H.\\nThank you very much for the sight of dearest Charles\\'s letter to\\nyourself. How pleasantly and how naturally he writes! and how perfect a\\npicture of his disposition and feelings his style conveys! Poor dear\\nfellow! Not a present!\\n\\nI have a great mind to send him all the twelve copies which were to have\\nbeen dispersed among my near connections, beginning with the P. R.[2]\\nand ending with Countess Morley.

I had the pleasure of\\nhearing from Mr. T. on Wednesday night that Mr. Seymour thought there\\nwas not the least occasion for his absenting himself any longer.\\n\\nI had also the comfort of a few lines on Wednesday morning from Henry\\nhimself, just after your letter was gone, giving so good an account of\\nhis feelings as made me perfectly easy. He met with the utmost care and\\nattention at Hanwell, spent his two days there very quietly and\\npleasantly, and being certainly in no respect the worse for going, we\\nmay believe that he must be better, as he is quite sure of being\\nhimself. To make his return a complete gala, Mr. Haden was secured for\\ndinner. I need not say that our evening was agreeable.\\n\\nBut you seem to be under a mistake as to Mr. H. You call him an\\napothecary. He is no apothecary; he has never been an apothecary; there\\nis not an apothecary in this neighborhood,--the only inconvenience of\\nthe situation, perhaps,--but so it is; we have not a medical man within\\nreach. He is a Haden, nothing but a Haden, a sort of wonderful\\nnondescript creature on two legs, something between a man and an angel,\\nbut without the least spice of an apothecary. He is, perhaps, the only\\nperson not an apothecary hereabouts. He has never sung to us. He will\\nnot sing without a pianoforte accompaniment.\\n\\nMr. Meyers gives his three lessons a week, altering his days and his\\nhours, however, just as he chooses, never very punctual, and never\\ngiving good measure. I have not Fanny's fondness for masters, and Mr.\\nMeyers does not give me any longing after them. The truth is, I think,\\nthat they are all, at least music-masters, made of too much consequence,\\nand allowed to take too many liberties with their scholars' time.\\n\\nWe shall be delighted to see Edward on Monday, only sorry that you must\\nbe losing him. A turkey will be equally welcome with himself. He must\\nprepare for his own proper bedchamber here, as Henry moved down to the\\none below last week; he found the other cold.\\n\\nI am sorry my mother has been suffering, and am afraid this exquisite\\nweather is too good to agree with her. I enjoy it all over me, from top\\nto toe, from right to left, longitudinally, perpendicularly, diagonally;\\nand I cannot but selfishly hope we are to have it last till\\nChristmas,--nice, unwholesome, unseasonable, relaxing, close, muggy\\nweather.\\n\\nOh, thank you very much for your long letter; it did me a great deal of\\ngood. Henry accepts your offer of making his nine gallon of mead\\nthankfully. The mistake of the dogs rather vexed him for a moment, but\\nhe has not thought of it since. To-day he makes a third attempt at his\\nstrengthening plaister, and as I am sure he will now be getting out a\\ngreat deal, it is to be wished that he may be able to keep it on. He\\nsets off this morning by the Chelsea coach to sign bonds and visit\\nHenrietta St., and I have no doubt will be going every day to Henrietta\\nSt.\\n\\nFanny and I were very snug by ourselves as soon as we were satisfied\\nabout our invalid's being safe at Hanwell. By manoeuvring and good luck\\nwe foiled all the Malings' attempts upon us. Happily I caught a little\\ncold on Wednesday, the morning we were in town, which we made very\\nuseful, and we saw nobody but our precious[38] and Mr. Tilson.\\n\\nThis evening the Malings are allowed to drink tea with us. We are in\\nhopes--that is, we wish--Miss Palmer and the little girls may come this\\nmorning. You know, of course, that she could not come on Thursday, and\\nshe will not attempt to name any other day.\\n\\nGod bless you. Excuse the shortness of this, but I must finish it now,\\nthat I may save you 2_d._ Best love.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,     J. A.\\n\\nIt strikes me that I have no business to give the P. R. a binding, but\\nwe will take counsel upon the question.\\n\\nI am glad you have put the flounce on your chintz; I am sure it must\\nlook particularly well, and it is what I had thought of.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    Chawton, Alton, Hants.\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[38] Probably a playful allusion to Mr. Haden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Such letters, such entertaining letters, as you have lately\\nsent! such a description of your queer little heart! such a lovely\\ndisplay of what imagination does! You are worth your weight in gold, or\\neven in the new silver coinage. I cannot express to you what I have felt\\nin reading your history of yourself,--how full of pity and concern, and\\nadmiration and amusement I have been! You are the paragon of all that is\\nsilly and sensible, commonplace and eccentric, sad and lively, provoking\\nand interesting. Who can keep pace with the fluctuations of your fancy,\\nthe capprizios of your taste, the contradictions of your feelings? You\\nare so odd, and all the time so perfectly natural!--so peculiar in\\nyourself, and yet so like everybody else!\\n\\nIt is very, very gratifying to me to know you so intimately. You can\\nhardly think what a pleasure it is to me to have such thorough pictures\\nof your heart. Oh, what a loss it will be when you are married! You are\\ntoo agreeable in your single state,--too agreeable as a niece. I shall\\nhate you when your delicious play of mind is all settled down into\\nconjugal and maternal affections.\\n\\nMr. B---- frightens me. He will have you. I see you at the altar. I have\\nsome faith in Mrs. C. Cage\\'s observation, and still more in Lizzy\\'s; and\\nbesides, I know it must be so. He must be wishing to attach you. It\\nwould be too stupid and too shameful in him to be otherwise; and all the\\nfamily are seeking your acquaintance.\\n\\nDo not imagine that I have any real objection; I have rather taken a\\nfancy to him than not, and I like the house for you. I only do not like\\nyou should marry anybody. And yet I do wish you to marry very much,\\nbecause I know you will never be happy till you are; but the loss of a\\nFanny Knight will be never made up to me. My \"affec. niece F. C. B----\"\\nwill be but a poor substitute. I do not like your being nervous, and so\\napt to cry,--it is a sign you are not quite well; but I hope Mr.\\nScud--as you always write his name (your Mr. Scuds amuse me very\\nmuch)--will do you good.\\n\\nWhat a comfort that Cassandra should be so recovered! It was more than\\nwe had expected. I can easily believe she was very patient and very\\ngood. I always loved Cassandra for her fine dark eyes and sweet temper.\\nI am almost entirely cured of my rheumatism,--just a little pain in my\\nknee now and then, to make me remember what it was, and keep on flannel.\\nAunt Cassandra nursed me so beautifully.\\n\\nI enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, it must be a great pleasure to you;\\nyou have not seen Fanny Cage in comfort so long. I hope she represents\\nand remonstrates and reasons with you properly. Why should you be living\\nin dread of his marrying somebody else? (Yet how natural!) You did not\\nchoose to have him yourself, why not allow him to take comfort where he\\ncan? In your conscience you know that he could not bear a companion with\\na more animated character. You cannot forget how you felt under the idea\\nof its having been possible that he might have dined in Hans Place.\\n\\nMy dearest Fanny, I cannot bear you should be unhappy about him. Think\\nof his principles; think of his father\\'s objection, of want of money,\\netc., etc. But I am doing no good; no, all that I urge against him will\\nrather make you take his part more,--sweet, perverse Fanny.\\n\\nAnd now I will tell you that we like your Henry to the utmost, to the\\nvery top of the glass, quite brimful. He is a very pleasing young man. I\\ndo not see how he could be mended. He does really bid fair to be\\neverything his father and sister could wish; and William I love very\\nmuch indeed, and so we do all; he is quite our own William. In short, we\\nare very comfortable together; that is, we can answer for ourselves.\\n\\nMrs. Deedes is as welcome as May to all our benevolence to her son; we\\nonly lamented that we could not do more, and that the 50_l._ note we\\nslipped into his hand at parting was necessarily the limit of our\\noffering. Good Mrs. Deedes! Scandal and gossip; yes, I dare say you are\\nwell stocked, but I am very fond of Mrs. ---- for reasons good. Thank\\nyou for mentioning her praise of \"Emma,\" etc.\\n\\nI have contributed the marking to Uncle H.\\'s shirts, and now they are a\\ncomplete memorial of the tender regard of many.\\n\\n_Friday._--I had no idea when I began this yesterday of sending it\\nbefore your brother went back, but I have written away my foolish\\nthoughts at such a rate that I will not keep them many hours longer to\\nstare me in the face.\\n\\nMuch obliged for the quadrilles, which I am grown to think pretty\\nenough, though of course they are very inferior to the cotillons of my\\nown day.\\n\\nBen and Anna walked here last Sunday to hear Uncle Henry, and she looked\\nso pretty, it was quite a pleasure to see her, so young and so blooming\\nand so innocent, as if she had never had a wicked thought in her life,\\nwhich yet one has some reason to suppose she must have had, if we\\nbelieve the doctrine of original sin. I hope Lizzy will have her play\\nvery kindly arranged for her. Henry is generally thought very\\ngood-looking, but not so handsome as Edward. I think I prefer his face.\\nWm. is in excellent looks, has a fine appetite, and seems perfectly\\nwell. You will have a great break up at Godmersham in the spring. You\\nmust feel their all going. It is very right, however! Poor Miss C.! I\\nshall pity her when she begins to understand herself.\\n\\nYour objection to the quadrilles delighted me exceedingly. Pretty well,\\nfor a lady irrecoverably attached to one person! Sweet Fanny, believe no\\nsuch thing of yourself, spread no such malicious slander upon your\\nunderstanding within the precincts of your imagination. Do not speak ill\\nof your sense merely for the gratification of your fancy; yours is sense\\nwhich deserves more honorable treatment. You are not in love with him;\\nyou never have been really in love with him.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                       J.

If I were to labor at it all the\\nrest of my life, and live to the age of Methuselah, I could never\\naccomplish anything so long and so perfect; but I cannot let William go\\nwithout a few lines of acknowledgment and reply.\\n\\nI have pretty well done with Mr. ----. By your description, he cannot be\\nin love with you, however he may try at it; and I could not wish the\\nmatch unless there were a great deal of love on his side. I do not know\\nwhat to do about Jemima Branfill. What does her dancing away with so\\nmuch spirit mean? That she does not care for him, or only wishes to\\nappear not to care for him? Who can understand a young lady?\\n\\nPoor Mrs. C. Milles, that she should die on the wrong day at last, after\\nbeing about it so long! It was unlucky that the Goodnestone party could\\nnot meet you; and I hope her friendly, obliging, social spirit, which\\ndelighted in drawing people together, was not conscious of the division\\nand disappointment she was occasioning. I am sorry and surprised that\\nyou speak of her as having little to leave, and must feel for Miss\\nMilles, though she is Molly, if a material loss of income is to attend\\nher other loss. Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor,\\nwhich is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony; but I need not\\ndwell on such arguments with you, pretty dear.\\n\\nTo you I shall say, as I have often said before, Do not be in a hurry,\\nthe right man will come at last; you will in the course of the next two\\nor three years meet with somebody more generally unexceptionable than\\nany one you have yet known, who will love you as warmly as possible, and\\nwho will so completely attract you that you will feel you never really\\nloved before.\\n\\nDo none of the A.\\'s ever come to balls now? You have never mentioned\\nthem as being at any. And what do you hear of the Gripps, or of Fanny\\nand her husband?\\n\\nAunt Cassandra walked to Wyards yesterday with Mrs. Digweed. Anna has\\nhad a bad cold, and looks pale. She has just weaned Julia.\\n\\nI have also heard lately from your Aunt Harriot, and cannot understand\\ntheir plans in parting with Miss S., whom she seems very much to value\\nnow that Harriot and Eleanor are both of an age for a governess to be so\\nuseful to, especially as, when Caroline was sent to school some years,\\nMiss Bell was still retained, though the others even then were nursery\\nchildren. They have some good reason, I dare say, though I cannot\\npenetrate it; and till I know what it is I shall invent a bad one, and\\namuse myself with accounting for the difference of measures by supposing\\nMiss S. to be a superior sort of woman, who has never stooped to\\nrecommend herself to the master of the family by flattery, as Miss Bell\\ndid.\\n\\nI will answer your kind questions more than you expect. \"Miss Catherine\"\\nis put upon the shelf for the present, and I do not know that she will\\never come out; but I have a something ready for publication, which may,\\nperhaps, appear about a twelvemonth hence. It is short,--about the\\nlength of \"Catherine.\" This is for yourself alone. Neither Mr. Salusbury\\nnor Mr. Wildman is to know of it.\\n\\nI am got tolerably well again, quite equal to walking about and enjoying\\nthe air, and by sitting down and resting a good while between my walks I\\nget exercise enough. I have a scheme, however, for accomplishing more,\\nas the weather grows spring-like. I mean to take to riding the donkey;\\nit will be more independent and less troublesome than the use of the\\ncarriage, and I shall be able to go about with Aunt Cassandra in her\\nwalks to Alton and Wyards.\\n\\nI hope you will think Wm. looking well; he was bilious the other day,\\nand At. Cass. supplied him with a dose at his own request. I am sure you\\nwould have approved it. Wm. and I are the best of friends. I love him\\nvery much. Everything is so natural about him,--his affections, his\\nmanners, and his drollery. He entertains and interests us extremely.\\n\\nMat. Hammond and A. M. Shaw are people whom I cannot care for in\\nthemselves, but I enter into their situation, and am glad they are so\\nhappy. If I were the Duchess of Richmond, I should be very miserable\\nabout my son\\'s choice.\\n\\nOur fears increase for poor little Harriot; the latest account is that\\nSir Ev. Home is confirmed in his opinion of there being water on the\\nbrain. I hope Heaven, in its mercy, will take her soon.

I have had\\na good deal of fever at times, and indifferent nights; but I am\\nconsiderably better now, and am recovering my looks a little, which have\\nbeen bad enough,--black and white, and every wrong color. I must not\\ndepend upon being ever very blooming again. Sickness is a dangerous\\nindulgence at my time of life. Thank you for everything you tell me. I\\ndo not feel worthy of it by anything that I can say in return, but I\\nassure you my pleasure in your letters is quite as great as ever, and I\\nam interested and amused just as you could wish me. If there is a Miss\\n_Marsden_, I perceive whom she will marry.\\n\\n_Evening._--I was languid and dull and very bad company when I wrote the\\nabove; I am better now, to my own feelings at least, and wish I may be\\nmore agreeable. We are going to have rain, and after that very pleasant\\ngenial weather, which will exactly do for me, as my saddle will then be\\ncompleted, and air and exercise is what I want. Indeed, I shall be very\\nglad when the event at Scarlets is over, the expectation of it keeps us\\nin a worry, your grandmamma especially; she sits brooding over evils\\nwhich cannot be remedied, and conduct impossible to be understood.\\n\\nNow the reports from Keppel St. are rather better; little Harriot's\\nheadaches are abated, and Sir Evd. is satisfied with the effect of the\\nmercury, and does not despair of a cure. The complaint I find is not\\nconsidered incurable nowadays, provided the patient be young enough not\\nto have the head hardened. The water in that case may be drawn off by\\nmercury. But though this is a new idea to us, perhaps it may have been\\nlong familiar to you through your friend Mr. Scud. I hope his high\\nrenown is sustained by driving away William's cough.\\n\\nTell Wm. that Triggs is as beautiful and condescending as ever, and was\\nso good as to dine with us to-day, and tell him that I often play at\\nnines and think of him.\\n\\nThe Papillons came back on Friday night, but I have not seen them yet,\\nas I do not venture to church. I cannot hear, however, but that they are\\nthe same Mr. P. and his sister they used to be. She has engaged a new\\nmaidservant in Mrs. Calker's room, whom she means to make also\\nhousekeeper under herself.\\n\\nOld Philmore was buried yesterday, and I, by way of saying something to\\nTriggs, observed that it had been a very handsome funeral; but his\\nmanner of reply made me suppose that it was not generally esteemed so. I\\ncan only be sure of one part being very handsome,--Triggs himself,\\nwalking behind in his green coat. Mrs. Philmore attended as chief\\nmourner, in bombazine, made very short, and flounced with crape.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--I have had various plans as to this letter, but at last I\\nhave determined that Uncle Henry shall forward it from London. I want to\\nsee how Canterbury looks in the direction. When once Uncle H. has left\\nus, I shall wish him with you. London has become a hateful place to him,\\nand he is always depressed by the idea of it. I hope he will be in time\\nfor your sick. I am sure he must do that part of his duty as excellently\\nas all the rest. He returned yesterday from Steventon, and was with us\\nby breakfast, bringing Edward with him, only that Edwd. stayed to\\nbreakfast at Wyards. We had a pleasant family day, for the Altons dined\\nwith us, the last visit of the kind probably which she will be able to\\npay us for many a month.\\n\\nI hope your own Henry is in France, and that you have heard from him;\\nthe passage once over, he will feel all happiness. I took my first ride\\nyesterday, and liked it very much. I went up Mounter's Lane and round by\\nwhere the new cottages are to be, and found the exercise and everything\\nvery pleasant; and I had the advantage of agreeable companions, as At.\\nCass. and Edward walked by my side. At. Cass. is such an excellent\\nnurse, so assiduous and unwearied! But you know all that already.\\n\\n                                   Very affectionately yours,\\n                                                          J.

       " '                                      CHAWTON, Sunday (Sept. 8, 1816).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I have borne the arrival of your letter to-day\\nextremely well; anybody might have thought it was giving me pleasure. I\\nam very glad you find so much to be satisfied with at Cheltenham. While\\nthe waters agree, everything else is trifling.\\n\\nA letter arrived for you from Charles last Thursday. They are all safe\\nand pretty well in Keppel St., the children decidedly better for\\nBroadstairs; and he writes principally to ask when it will be convenient\\nto us to receive Miss P., the little girls, and himself. They would be\\nready to set off in ten days from the time of his writing, to pay their\\nvisits in Hampshire and Berkshire, and he would prefer coming to Chawton\\nfirst.\\n\\nI have answered him, and said that we hoped it might suit them to wait\\ntill the last week in Septr., as we could not ask them sooner, either on\\nyour account or the want of room. I mentioned the 23rd as the probable\\nday of your return. When you have once left Cheltenham, I shall grudge\\nevery half-day wasted on the road. If there were but a coach from\\nHungerford to Chawton! I have desired him to let me hear again soon.\\n\\nHe does not include a maid in the list to be accommodated; but if they\\nbring one, as I suppose they will, we shall have no bed in the house\\neven then for Charles himself,--let alone Henry. But what can we do?\\n\\nWe shall have the Gt. House quite at our command; it is to be cleared of\\nthe Papillons\\' servants in a day or two. They themselves have been\\nhurried off into Essex to take possession,--not of a large estate left\\nthem by an uncle, but to scrape together all they can, I suppose, of the\\neffects of a Mrs. Rawstorn, a rich old friend and cousin suddenly\\ndeceased, to whom they are joint executors. So there is a happy end of\\nthe Kentish Papillons coming here.\\n\\nNo morning service to-day, wherefore I am writing between twelve and one\\no\\'clock. Mr. Benn in the afternoon, and likewise more rain again, by the\\nlook and the sound of things. You left us in doubt of Mrs. Benn\\'s\\nsituation, but she has bespoke her nurse. . . . The F. A.\\'s dined with\\nus yesterday, and had fine weather both for coming and going home, which\\nhas hardly ever happened to them before. She is still unprovided with a\\nhousemaid.\\n\\nOur day at Alton was very pleasant, venison quite right, children well\\nbehaved, and Mr. and Mrs. Digweed taking kindly to our charades and\\nother games. I must also observe, for his mother\\'s satisfaction, that\\nEdward at my suggestion devoted himself very properly to the\\nentertainment of Miss S. Gibson. Nothing was wanting except Mr. Sweeney;\\nbut he, alas! had been ordered away to London the day before. We had a\\nbeautiful walk home by moonlight.\\n\\nThank you, my back has given me scarcely any pain for many days. I have\\nan idea that agitation does it as much harm as fatigue, and that I was\\nill at the time of your going from the very circumstance of your going.\\nI am nursing myself up now into as beautiful a state as I can, because I\\nhear that Dr. White means to call on me before he leaves the country.\\n\\n_Evening._--Frank and Mary and the children visited us this morning. Mr.\\nand Mrs. Gibson are to come on the 23rd, and there is too much reason to\\nfear they will stay above a week. Little George could tell me where you\\nwere gone to, as well as what you were to bring him, when I asked him\\nthe other day.\\n\\nSir Tho. Miller is dead. I treat you with a dead baronet in almost every\\nletter.\\n\\nSo you have C. Craven among you, as well as the Duke of Orleans and Mr.\\nPocock. But it mortifies me that you have not added one to the stock of\\ncommon acquaintance. Do pray meet with somebody belonging to yourself. I\\nam quite weary of your knowing nobody.\\n\\nMrs. Digweed parts with both Hannah and old cook: the former will not\\ngive up her lover, who is a man of bad character; the latter is guilty\\nonly of being unequal to anything.\\n\\nMiss Terry was to have spent this week with her sister, but as usual it\\nis put off. My amiable friend knows the value of her company. I have not\\nseen Anna since the day you left us; her father and brother visited her\\nmost days. Edward and Ben called here on Thursday. Edward was in his way\\nto Selborne. We found him very agreeable. He is come back from France,\\nthinking of the French as one could wish,--disappointed in everything.\\nHe did not go beyond Paris.\\n\\nI have a letter from Mrs. Perigord; she and her mother are in London\\nagain. She speaks of France as a scene of general poverty and misery: no\\nmoney, no trade, nothing to be got but by the innkeepers, and as to her\\nown present prospects she is not much less melancholy than before.\\n\\nI have also a letter from Miss Sharp, quite one of her letters; she has\\nbeen again obliged to exert herself more than ever, in a more\\ndistressing, more harassed state, and has met with another excellent old\\nphysician and his wife, with every virtue under heaven, who takes to her\\nand cures her from pure love and benevolence. Dr. and Mrs. Storer are\\ntheir Mrs. and Miss Palmer--for they are at Bridlington. I am happy to\\nsay, however, that the sum of the account is better than usual. Sir\\nWilliam is returned; from Bridlington they go to Chevet, and she is to\\nhave a young governess under her.\\n\\nI enjoyed Edward\\'s company very much, as I said before, and yet I was\\nnot sorry when Friday came. It had been a busy week, and I wanted a few\\ndays\\' quiet and exemption from the thought and contrivancy which any\\nsort of company gives. I often wonder how you can find time for what you\\ndo, in addition to the care of the house; and how good Mrs. West could\\nhave written such books and collected so many hard words, with all her\\nfamily cares, is still more a matter of astonishment. Composition seems\\nto me impossible with a head full of joints of mutton and doses of\\nrhubarb.\\n\\n_Monday._--Here is a sad morning. I fear you may not have been able to\\nget to the Pump. The two last days were very pleasant. I enjoyed them\\nthe more for your sake. But to-day it is really bad enough to make you\\nall cross. I hope Mary will change her lodgings at the fortnight\\'s end;\\nI am sure, if you looked about well, you would find others in some odd\\ncorner to suit you better. Mrs. Potter charges for the name of the High\\nSt.\\n\\nSuccess to the pianoforte! I trust it will drive you away. We hear now\\nthat there is to be no honey this year. Bad news for us. We must\\nhusband our present stock of mead, and I am sorry to perceive that our\\ntwenty gallons is very nearly out. I cannot comprehend how the fourteen\\ngallons could last so long.\\n\\nWe do not much like Mr. Cooper\\'s new sermons. They are fuller of\\nregeneration and conversion than ever, with the addition of his zeal in\\nthe cause of the Bible Society.\\n\\nMartha\\'s love to Mary and Caroline, and she is extremely glad to find\\nthey like the pelisse. The Debarys are indeed odious! We are to see my\\nbrother to-morrow, but for only one night. I had no idea that he would\\ncare for the races without Edward. Remember me to all.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                        J.

In April\\nher father in a note to Mrs. Lefroy says: \"I was happy to have a good\\naccount of herself written by her own hand, in a letter from your Aunt\\nJane; but all who love, and that is all who know her, must be anxious on\\nher account.\" We all know how well grounded that anxiety was, and how\\nsoon her relations had to lament over the loss of the dearest and\\nbrightest member of their family.\\n\\nAnd now I come to the saddest letters of all, those which tell us of the\\nend of that bright life, cut short just at the time when the world might\\nhave hoped that unabated intellectual vigor, supplemented by the\\nexperience brought by maturer years, would have produced works if\\npossible even more fascinating than those with which she had already\\nembellished the literature of her country. But it was not to be. The\\nfiat had gone forth,--the ties which bound that sweet spirit to earth\\nwere to be severed, and a blank left, never to be filled in the family\\nwhich her loved and loving presence had blessed, and where she had been\\nso well and fondly appreciated. In the early spring of 1817 the\\nunfavorable symptoms increased, and the failure of her health was too\\nvisible to be neglected. Still no apprehensions of immediate danger were\\nentertained, and it is probable that when she left Chawton for\\nWinchester in May, she did not recognize the fact that she was bidding a\\nlast farewell to \"Home.\" Happy for her if it was so, for there are few\\nthings more melancholy than to look upon any beloved place or person\\nwith the knowledge that it is for \"the last time.\" In all probability\\nthis grief was spared to Jane, for even after her arrival at Winchester\\nshe spoke and wrote as if recovery was hopeful; and I fancy that her\\nrelations were by no means aware that the end was so near.\\n\\n\\n_Note by Lord Brabourne._\\n\\nCassandra\\'s letters tell the tale of the event in words that require no\\naddition from me. They are simple and affecting,--the words of one who\\nhad been stricken by a great grief, but whose religion stood her in\\ngood stead, and enabled her to bear it with fortitude. The firm and\\nloving bond of union which had ever united the Austen family, naturally\\nintensified their sorrow at the loss of one of their number, and that\\nthe one of whom they had been so proud as well as so fond. They laid her\\nwithin the walls of the old cathedral which she had loved so much, and\\nwent sorrowfully back to their homes, with the feeling that nothing\\ncould replace to them the treasure they had lost. And most heavily of\\nall must the blow have fallen upon the only sister, the correspondent,\\nthe companion, the other self of Jane, who had to return alone to the\\ndesolate home, and to the mother to whose comforts the two had hitherto\\nministered together, but who would henceforward have her alone on whom\\nto rely. . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      _Letters from Miss Cassandra Austen to her niece Miss\\n      Knight, after the death of her sister Jane, July 18,\\n      1817._\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '                                               WINCHESTER, Sunday.\\n\\nMY DEAREST FANNY,--Doubly dear to me now for her dear sake whom we have\\nlost. She did love you most sincerely, and never shall I forget the\\nproofs of love you gave her during her illness in writing those kind,\\namusing letters at a time when I know your feelings would have dictated\\nso different a style. Take the only reward I can give you in the\\nassurance that your benevolent purpose was answered; you did contribute\\nto her enjoyment.\\n\\nEven your last letter afforded pleasure. I merely cut the seal and gave\\nit to her; she opened it and read it herself, afterwards she gave it to\\nme to read, and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully of its\\ncontents, but there was then a languor about her which prevented her\\ntaking the same interest in anything she had been used to do.\\n\\nSince Tuesday evening, when her complaint returned, there was a visible\\nchange, she slept more and much more comfortably; indeed, during the\\nlast eight-and-forty hours she was more asleep than awake. Her looks\\naltered and she fell away, but I perceived no material diminution of\\nstrength, and though I was then hopeless of a recovery, I had no\\nsuspicion how rapidly my loss was approaching.\\n\\nI have lost a treasure, such a sister, such a friend as never can have\\nbeen surpassed. She was the sun of my life, the gilder of every\\npleasure, the soother of every sorrow; I had not a thought concealed\\nfrom her, and it is as if I had lost a part of myself. I loved her only\\ntoo well,--not better than she deserved, but I am conscious that my\\naffection for her made me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others;\\nand I can acknowledge, more than as a general principle, the justice of\\nthe Hand which has struck this blow.\\n\\nYou know me too well to be at all afraid that I should suffer materially\\nfrom my feelings; I am perfectly conscious of the extent of my\\nirreparable loss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little\\nindisposed,--nothing but what a short time, with rest and change of air,\\nwill remove. I thank God that I was enabled to attend her to the last,\\nand amongst my many causes of self-reproach I have not to add any wilful\\nneglect of her comfort.\\n\\nShe felt herself to be dying about half an hour before she became\\ntranquil and apparently unconscious. During that half-hour was her\\nstruggle, poor soul! She said she could not tell us what she suffered,\\nthough she complained of little fixed pain. When I asked her if there\\nwas anything she wanted, her answer was she wanted nothing but death,\\nand some of her words were: \"God grant me patience, pray for me, oh,\\npray for me!\" Her voice was affected, but as long as she spoke she was\\nintelligible.\\n\\nI hope I do not break your heart, my dearest Fanny, by these\\nparticulars; I mean to afford you gratification whilst I am relieving my\\nown feelings. I could not write so to anybody else; indeed you are the\\nonly person I have written to at all, excepting your grandmamma,--it\\nwas to her, not your Uncle Charles, I wrote on Friday.\\n\\nImmediately after dinner on Thursday I went into the town to do an\\nerrand which your dear aunt was anxious about. I returned about a\\nquarter before six, and found her recovering from faintness and\\noppression; she got so well as to be able to give me a minute account of\\nher seizure, and when the clock struck six she was talking quietly to\\nme.\\n\\nI cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized again with the same\\nfaintness, which was followed by the sufferings she could not describe;\\nbut Mr. Lyford had been sent for, had applied something to give her\\nease, and she was in a state of quiet insensibility by seven o\\'clock at\\nthe latest. From that time till half-past four, when she ceased to\\nbreathe, she scarcely moved a limb, so that we have every reason to\\nthink, with gratitude to the Almighty, that her sufferings were over. A\\nslight motion of the head with every breath remained till almost the\\nlast. I sat close to her with a pillow in my lap to assist in supporting\\nher head, which was almost off the bed, for six hours; fatigue made me\\nthen resign my place to Mrs. J. A. for two hours and a half, when I took\\nit again, and in about an hour more she breathed her last.\\n\\nI was able to close her eyes myself, and it was a great gratification to\\nme to render her those last services. There was nothing convulsed which\\ngave the idea of pain in her look; on the contrary, but for the\\ncontinual motion of the head she gave one the idea of a beautiful\\nstatue, and even now, in her coffin, there is such a sweet, serene air\\nover her countenance as is quite pleasant to contemplate.\\n\\nThis day, my dearest Fanny, you have had the melancholy intelligence,\\nand I know you suffer severely, but I likewise know that you will apply\\nto the fountain-head for consolation, and that our merciful God is never\\ndeaf to such prayers as you will offer.\\n\\nThe last sad ceremony is to take place on Thursday morning; her dear\\nremains are to be deposited in the cathedral. It is a satisfaction to me\\nto think that they are to lie in a building she admired so much; her\\nprecious soul, I presume to hope, reposes in a far superior mansion. May\\nmine one day be reunited to it!\\n\\nYour dear papa, your Uncle Henry, and Frank and Edwd. Austen, instead of\\nhis father, will attend. I hope they will none of them suffer lastingly\\nfrom their pious exertions. The ceremony must be over before ten\\no\\'clock, as the cathedral service begins at that hour, so that we shall\\nbe at home early in the day, for there will be nothing to keep us here\\nafterwards.\\n\\nYour Uncle James came to us yesterday, and is gone home to-day. Uncle\\nH. goes to Chawton to-morrow morning; he has given every necessary\\ndirection here, and I think his company there will do good. He returns\\nto us again on Tuesday evening.\\n\\nI did not think to have written a long letter when I began, but I have\\nfound the employment draw me on, and I hope I shall have been giving you\\nmore pleasure than pain. Remember me kindly to Mrs. J. Bridges (I am so\\nglad she is with you now), and give my best love to Lizzie and all the\\nothers.\\n\\n           I am, my dearest Fanny,\\n                         Most affectionately yours,\\n                                                CASS.

Nothing of the sort could\\nhave been more gratifying to me than the manner in which you write of\\nher; and if the dear angel is conscious of what passes here, and is not\\nabove all earthly feelings, she may perhaps receive pleasure in being so\\nmourned. Had she been the survivor, I can fancy her speaking of you in\\nalmost the same terms. There are certainly many points of strong\\nresemblance in your characters; in your intimate acquaintance with each\\nother, and your mutual strong affection, you were counterparts.\\n\\nThursday was not so dreadful a day to me as you imagined. There was so\\nmuch necessary to be done that there was no time for additional misery.\\nEverything was conducted with the greatest tranquillity, and but that I\\nwas determined I would see the last, and therefore was upon the listen,\\nI should not have known when they left the house. I watched the little\\nmournful procession the length of the street; and when it turned from my\\nsight, and I had lost her forever, even then I was not overpowered, nor\\nso much agitated as I am now in writing of it. Never was human being\\nmore sincerely mourned by those who attended her remains than was this\\ndear creature. May the sorrow with which she is parted with on earth be\\na prognostic of the joy with which she is hailed in heaven!\\n\\nI continue very tolerably well,--much better than any one could have\\nsupposed possible, because I certainly have had considerable fatigue of\\nbody as well as anguish of mind for months back; but I really am well,\\nand I hope I am properly grateful to the Almighty for having been so\\nsupported. Your grandmamma, too, is much better than when I came home.\\n\\nI did not think your dear papa appeared unwell, and I understand that he\\nseemed much more comfortable after his return from Winchester than he\\nhad done before. I need not tell you that he was a great comfort to me;\\nindeed, I can never say enough of the kindness I have received from him\\nand from every other friend.\\n\\nI get out of doors a good deal, and am able to employ myself. Of course\\nthose employments suit me best which leave me most at leisure to think\\nof her I have lost, and I do think of her in every variety of\\ncircumstance,--in our happy hours of confidential intercourse, in the\\ncheerful family party which she so ornamented, in her sick-room, on her\\ndeath-bed, and as (I hope) an inhabitant of heaven. Oh, if I may one day\\nbe reunited to her there! I know the time must come when my mind will be\\nless engrossed by her idea, but I do not like to think of it. If I think\\nof her less as on earth, God grant that I may never cease to reflect on\\nher as inhabiting heaven, and never cease my humble endeavors (when it\\nshall please God) to join her there.\\n\\nIn looking at a few of the precious papers which are now my property I\\nhave found some memorandums, amongst which she desires that one of her\\ngold chains may be given to her god-daughter Louisa, and a lock of her\\nhair be set for you. You can need no assurance, my dearest Fanny, that\\nevery request of your beloved aunt will be sacred with me. Be so good as\\nto say whether you prefer a brooch or ring. God bless you, my dearest\\nFanny.\\n\\n             Believe me, most affectionately yours,\\n                                             CASS. ELIZTH.

I do not at all\\nexpect to see you on Tuesday, since matters have fallen out so\\nunpleasantly; and if you are not able to return till after that day, it\\nwill hardly be possible for us to send for you before Saturday, though\\nfor my own part I care so little about the ball that it would be no\\nsacrifice to me to give it up for the sake of seeing you two days\\nearlier. We are extremely sorry for poor Eliza's illness. I trust,\\nhowever, that she has continued to recover since you wrote, and that you\\nwill none of you be the worse for your attendance on her. What a\\ngood-for-nothing fellow Charles is to bespeak the stockings! I hope he\\nwill be too hot all the rest of his life for it!\\n\\nI sent you a letter yesterday to Ibthorp, which I suppose you will not\\nreceive at Kintbury. It was not very long or very witty, and therefore\\nif you never receive it, it does not much signify. I wrote principally\\nto tell you that the Coopers were arrived and in good health. The little\\nboy is very like Dr. Cooper, and the little girl is to resemble Jane,\\nthey say.\\n\\nOur party to Ashe to-morrow night will consist of Edward Cooper, James\\n(for a ball is nothing without him), Buller, who is now staying with us,\\nand I. I look forward with great impatience to it, as I rather expect to\\nreceive an offer from my friend in the course of the evening. I shall\\nrefuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat.\\n\\nI am very much flattered by your commendation of my last letter, for I\\nwrite only for fame, and without any view to pecuniary emolument.\\n\\nEdward is gone to spend the day with his friend, John Lyford, and does\\nnot return till to-morrow. Anna is now here; she came up in her chaise\\nto spend the day with her young cousins, but she does not much take to\\nthem or to anything about them, except Caroline's spinning-wheel. I am\\nvery glad to find from Mary that Mr. and Mrs. Fowle are pleased with\\nyou. I hope you will continue to give satisfaction.\\n\\nHow impertinent you are to write to me about Tom, as if I had not\\nopportunities of hearing from him myself! The last letter that I\\nreceived from him was dated on Friday, 8th, and he told me that if the\\nwind should be favorable on Sunday, which it proved to be, they were to\\nsail from Falmouth on that day. By this time, therefore, they are at\\nBarbadoes, I suppose. The Rivers are still at Manydown, and are to be at\\nAshe to-morrow. I intended to call on the Miss Biggs yesterday had the\\nweather been tolerable. Caroline, Anna, and I have just been devouring\\nsome cold souse, and it would be difficult to say which enjoyed it most.\\n\\nTell Mary that I make over Mr. Heartley and all his estate to her for\\nher sole use and benefit in future, and not only him, but all my other\\nadmirers into the bargain wherever she can find them, even the kiss\\nwhich C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I mean to confine myself in\\nfuture to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care sixpence. Assure her\\nalso, as a last and indubitable proof of Warren's indifference to me,\\nthat he actually drew that gentleman's picture for me, and delivered it\\nto me without a sigh.\\n\\n_Friday._--At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with\\nTom Lefroy, and when you receive this it will be over. My tears flow as\\nI write at the melancholy idea. Wm. Chute called here yesterday. I\\nwonder what he means by being so civil. There is a report that Tom is\\ngoing to be married to a Lichfield lass. John Lyford and his sister\\nbring Edward home to-day, dine with us, and we shall all go together to\\nAshe. I understand that we are to draw for partners. I shall be\\nextremely impatient to hear from you again, that I may know how Eliza\\nis, and when you are to return.\\n\\nWith best love, etc., I am affectionately yours,\\n\\n                                                  J.

Let me know how\\nmany, besides their fourteen selves and Mr. and Mrs. Wright, Michael\\nwill contrive to place about their coach, and how many of the gentlemen,\\nmusicians, and waiters he will have persuaded to come in their\\nshooting-jackets. I hope John Lovett's accident will not prevent his\\nattending the ball, as you will otherwise be obliged to dance with Mr.\\nTincton the whole evening. Let me know how J. Harwood deports himself\\nwithout the Miss Biggs, and which of the Marys will carry the day with\\nmy brother James.\\n\\n_We_ were at a ball on Saturday, I assure you. We dined at Goodnestone,\\nand in the evening danced two country-dances and the Boulangeries. I\\nopened the ball with Edward Bridges; the other couples were Lewis Cage\\nand Harriet, Frank and Louisa, Fanny and George. Elizabeth played one\\ncountry-dance, Lady Bridges the other, which she made Henry dance with\\nher, and Miss Finch played the Boulangeries.\\n\\nIn reading over the last three or four lines, I am aware of my having\\nexpressed myself in so doubtful a manner that if I did not tell you to\\nthe contrary, you might imagine it was Lady Bridges who made Henry dance\\nwith her at the same time that she was playing, which, if not\\nimpossible, must appear a very improbable event to you. But it was\\nElizabeth who danced. We supped there, and walked home at night under\\nthe shade of two umbrellas.\\n\\nTo-day the Goodnestone party begins to disperse and spread itself\\nabroad. Mr. and Mrs. Cage and George repair to Hythe. Lady Waltham, Miss\\nBridges, and Miss Mary Finch to Dover, for the health of the two former.\\nI have never seen Marianne at all. On Thursday Mr. and Mrs. Bridges\\nreturn to Danbury; Miss Harriet Hales accompanies them to London on her\\nway to Dorsetshire.\\n\\nFarmer Claringbould died this morning, and I fancy Edward means to get\\nsome of his farm, if he can cheat Sir Brook enough in the agreement.\\n\\nWe have just got some venison from Godmersham, which the two Mr. Harveys\\nare to dine on to-morrow, and on Friday or Saturday the Goodnestone\\npeople are to finish their scraps. Henry went away on Friday, as he\\npurposed, _without fayl_. You will hear from him soon, I imagine, as he\\ntalked of writing to Steventon shortly. Mr. Richard Harvey is going to\\nbe married; but as it is a great secret, and only known to half the\\nneighborhood, you must not mention it. The lady's name is Musgrave.\\n\\nI am in great distress. I cannot determine whether I shall give Richis\\nhalf a guinea or only five shillings when I go away. Counsel me, amiable\\nMiss Austen, and tell me which will be the most.\\n\\nWe walked Frank last night to Crixhall Ruff, and he appeared much\\nedified. Little Edward was breeched yesterday for good and all, and was\\nwhipped into the bargain.\\n\\nPray remember me to everybody who does not inquire after me; those who\\ndo, remember me without bidding.

       "  'text': 'ROWLING, Thursday (September 15).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--We have been very gay since I wrote last; dining at\\nNackington, returning by moonlight, and everything quite in style, not\\nto mention Mr. Claringbould\\'s funeral which we saw go by on Sunday. I\\nbelieve I told you in a former letter that Edward had some idea of\\ntaking the name of Claringbould; but that scheme is over, though it\\nwould be a very eligible as well as a very pleasant plan, would any one\\nadvance him money enough to begin on. We rather expected Mr. Milles to\\nhave done so on Tuesday; but to our great surprise nothing was said on\\nthe subject, and unless it is in your power to assist your brother with\\nfive or six hundred pounds, he must entirely give up the idea.\\n\\nAt Nackington we met Lady Sondes\\' picture over the mantelpiece in the\\ndining-room, and the pictures of her three children in an ante-room,\\nbesides Mr. Scott, Miss Fletcher, Mr. Toke, Mr. J. Toke, and the\\narchdeacon Lynch. Miss Fletcher and I were very thick, but I am the\\nthinnest of the two. She wore her purple muslin, which is pretty\\nenough, though it does not become her complexion. There are two traits\\nin her character which are pleasing,--namely, she admires Camilla, and\\ndrinks no cream in her tea. If you should ever see Lucy, you may tell\\nher that I scolded Miss Fletcher for her negligence in writing, as she\\ndesired me to do, but without being able to bring her to any proper\\nsense of shame,--that Miss Fletcher says, in her defence, that as\\neverybody whom Lucy knew when she was in Canterbury has now left it, she\\nhas nothing at all to write to her about. By _everybody_, I suppose Miss\\nFletcher means that a new set of officers have arrived there. But this\\nis a note of my own.\\n\\nMrs. Milles, Mr. John Toke, and in short everybody of any sensibility\\ninquired in tender strains after you, and I took an opportunity of\\nassuring Mr. J. T. that neither he nor his father need longer keep\\nthemselves single for you.\\n\\nWe went in our two carriages to Nackington; but how we divided I shall\\nleave you to surmise, merely observing that as Elizabeth and I were\\nwithout either hat or bonnet, it would not have been very convenient for\\nus to go in the chaise. We went by Bifrons, and I contemplated with a\\nmelancholy pleasure the abode of him on whom I once fondly doated. We\\ndine to-day at Goodnestone, to meet my aunt Fielding from Margate and a\\nMr. Clayton, her professed admirer--at least, so I imagine. Lady Bridges\\nhas received very good accounts of Marianne, who is already certainly\\nthe better for her bathing.\\n\\nSo His Royal Highness Sir Thomas Williams has at length sailed; the\\npapers say \"on a cruise.\" But I hope they are gone to Cork, or I shall\\nhave written in vain. Give my love to Jane, as she arrived at Steventon\\nyesterday, I dare say.\\n\\nI sent a message to Mr. Digweed from Edward in a letter to Mary Lloyd\\nwhich she ought to receive to-day; but as I know that the Harwoods are\\nnot very exact as to their letters, I may as well repeat it to you. Mr.\\nDigweed is to be informed that illness has prevented Seward\\'s coming\\nover to look at the repairs intended at the farm, but that he will come\\nas soon as he can. Mr. Digweed may also be informed, if you think\\nproper, that Mr. and Mrs. Milles are to dine here to-morrow, and that\\nMrs. Joan Knatchbull is to be asked to meet them. Mr. Richard Harvey\\'s\\nmatch is put off till he has got a better Christian name, of which he\\nhas great hopes.\\n\\nMr. Children\\'s two sons are both going to be married, John and George.\\nThey are to have one wife between them, a Miss Holwell, who belongs to\\nthe Black Hole at Calcutta. I depend on hearing from James very soon; he\\npromised me an account of the ball, and by this time he must have\\ncollected his ideas enough after the fatigue of dancing to give me one.\\n\\nEdward and Fly went out yesterday very early in a couple of shooting\\njackets, and came home like a couple of bad shots, for they killed\\nnothing at all. They are out again to-day, and are not yet returned.\\nDelightful sport! They are just come home, Edward with his two brace,\\nFrank with his two and a half. What amiable young men!\\n\\n_Friday._--Your letter and one from Henry are just come, and the\\ncontents of both accord with my scheme more than I had dared expect. In\\none particular I could wish it otherwise, for Henry is very indifferent\\nindeed. You must not expect us quite so early, however, as Wednesday,\\nthe 20th,--on that day se\\'nnight, according to our present plan, we may\\nbe with you. Frank had never any idea of going away before Monday, the\\n26th. I shall write to Miss Mason immediately, and press her returning\\nwith us, which Henry thinks very likely, and particularly eligible.\\n\\nBuy Mary Harrison\\'s gown by all means. You shall have mine for ever so\\nmuch money, though, if I am tolerably rich when I get home, I shall like\\nit very much myself.\\n\\nAs to the mode of our travelling to town, _I_ want to go in a\\nstage-coach, but Frank will not let me. As you are likely to have the\\nWilliams and Lloyds with you next week, you would hardly find room for\\nus then. If any one wants anything in town, they must send their\\ncommissions to Frank, as _I_ shall merely pass through it.

       "  'text': 'ROWLING, Sunday (September 18).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--This morning has been spent in doubt and\\ndeliberation, in forming plans and removing difficulties, for it ushered\\nin the day with an event which I had not intended should take place so\\nsoon by a week. Frank has received his appointment on board the \"Captain\\nJohn Gore,\" commanded by the \"Triton,\" and will therefore be obliged to\\nbe in town on Wednesday; and though I have every disposition in the\\nworld to accompany him on that day, I cannot go on the uncertainty of\\nthe Pearsons being at home, as I should not have a place to go to in\\ncase they were from home.\\n\\nI wrote to Miss P. on Friday, and hoped to receive an answer from her\\nthis morning, which would have rendered everything smooth and easy, and\\nwould have enabled us to leave this place to-morrow, as Frank, on first\\nreceiving his appointment, intended to do. He remains till Wednesday\\nmerely to accommodate me. I have written to her again to-day, and\\ndesired her to answer it by return of post. On Tuesday, therefore, I\\nshall positively know whether they can receive me on Wednesday. If they\\ncannot, Edward has been so good as to promise to take me to Greenwich on\\nthe Monday following, which was the day before fixed on, if that suits\\nthem better. If I have no answer at all on Tuesday, I must suppose Mary\\nis not at home, and must wait till I do hear, as after having invited\\nher to go to Steventon with me, it will not quite do to go home and say\\nno more about it.\\n\\nMy father will be so good as to fetch home his prodigal daughter from\\ntown, I hope, unless he wishes me to walk the hospitals, enter at the\\nTemple, or mount guard at St. James\\'. It will hardly be in Frank\\'s power\\nto take me home,--nay, it certainly will not. I shall write again as\\nsoon as I get to Greenwich.\\n\\nWhat dreadful hot weather we have! It keeps one in a continual state of\\ninelegance.\\n\\nIf Miss Pearson should return with me, pray be careful not to expect too\\nmuch beauty. I will not pretend to say that on a first view she quite\\nanswered the opinion I had formed of her. My mother, I am sure, will be\\ndisappointed if she does not take great care. From what I remember of\\nher picture, it is no great resemblance.\\n\\nI am very glad that the idea of returning with Frank occurred to me; for\\nas to Henry\\'s coming into Kent again, the time of its taking place is so\\nvery uncertain that I should be waiting for dead men\\'s shoes. I had once\\ndetermined to go with Frank to-morrow and take my chance, etc., but they\\ndissuaded me from so rash a step as I really think on consideration it\\nwould have been; for if the Pearsons were not at home, I should\\ninevitably fall a sacrifice to the arts of some fat woman who would make\\nme drunk with small beer.\\n\\nMary is brought to bed of a boy,--both doing very well. I shall leave\\nyou to guess what Mary I mean. Adieu, with best love to all your\\nagreeable inmates. Don\\'t let the Lloyds go on any account before I\\nreturn, unless Miss P. is of the party. How ill I have written! I begin\\nto hate myself.\\n\\n                                                 Yours ever,\\n                                                          J.

I am now able to send you a\\ncontinuation of the same good account of her. She was very little\\nfatigued on her arrival at this place, has been refreshed by a\\ncomfortable dinner, and now seems quite stout. It wanted five minutes of\\ntwelve when we left Sittingbourne, from whence we had a famous pair of\\nhorses, which took us to Rochester in an hour and a quarter; the postboy\\nseemed determined to show my mother that Kentish drivers were not always\\ntedious, and really drove as fast as Cax.\\n\\nOur next stage was not quite so expeditiously performed; the road was\\nheavy, and our horses very indifferent. However, we were in such good\\ntime and my mother bore her journey so well, that expedition was of\\nlittle importance to us; and as it was, we were very little more than\\ntwo hours and a half coming hither, and it was scarcely past four when\\nwe stopped at the inn. My mother took some of her bitters at Ospringe,\\nand some more at Rochester, and she ate some bread several times.\\n\\nWe have got apartments up two pair of stairs, as we could not be\\notherwise accommodated with a sitting-room and bed-chambers on the same\\nfloor which we wished to be. We have one double-bedded and one\\nsingle-bedded room; in the former my mother and I are to sleep. I shall\\nleave you to guess who is to occupy the other. We sate down to dinner a\\nlittle after five, and had some beef-steaks and a boiled fowl, but no\\noyster sauce.\\n\\nI should have begun my letter soon after our arrival, but for a little\\nadventure which prevented me. After we had been here a quarter of an\\nhour it was discovered that my writing and dressing boxes had been by\\naccident put into a chaise which was just packing off as we came in, and\\nwere driven away toward Gravesend in their way to the West Indies. No\\npart of my property could have been such a prize before, for in my\\nwriting-box was all my worldly wealth, 7_l._, and my dear Harry\\'s\\ndeputation. Mr. Nottley immediately despatched a man and horse after the\\nchaise, and in half an hour\\'s time I had the pleasure of being as rich\\nas ever; they were got about two or three miles off.\\n\\nMy day\\'s journey has been pleasanter in every respect than I expected. I\\nhave been very little crowded and by no means unhappy. Your\\nwatchfulness with regard to the weather on our accounts was very kind\\nand very effectual. We had one heavy shower on leaving Sittingbourne,\\nbut afterwards the clouds cleared away, and we had a very bright\\n_chrystal_ afternoon.\\n\\nMy father is now reading the \"Midnight Bell,\" which he has got from the\\nlibrary, and mother sitting by the fire. Our route to-morrow is not\\ndetermined. We have none of us much inclination for London, and if Mr.\\nNottley will give us leave, I think we shall go to Staines through\\nCroydon and Kingston, which will be much pleasanter than any other way;\\nbut he is decidedly for Clapham and Battersea. God bless you all!\\n\\n                                         Yours affectionately, J. A.\\n\\nI flatter myself that _itty Dordy_ will not forget me at least under a\\nweek.

Soon after I had finished my letter from Staines, my\\nmother began to suffer from the exercise or fatigue of travelling, and\\nshe was a good deal indisposed. She had not a very good night at\\nStaines, but bore her journey better than I had expected, and at\\nBasingstoke, where we stopped more than half an hour, received much\\ncomfort from a mess of broth and the sight of Mr. Lyford, who\\nrecommended her to take twelve drops of laudanum when she went to bed as\\na composer, which she accordingly did.\\n\\nJames called on us just as we were going to tea, and my mother was well\\nenough to talk very cheerfully to him before she went to bed. James\\nseems to have taken to his old trick of coming to Steventon in spite of\\nMary\\'s reproaches, for he was here before breakfast and is now paying us\\na second visit. They were to have dined here to-day, but the weather is\\ntoo bad. I have had the pleasure of hearing that Martha is with them.\\nJames fetched her from Ibthorp on Thursday, and she will stay with them\\ntill she removes to Kintbury.\\n\\nWe met with no adventures at all in our journey yesterday, except that\\nour trunk had once nearly slipped off, and we were obliged to stop at\\nHartley to have our wheels greased.\\n\\nWhilst my mother and Mr. Lyford were together I went to Mrs. Ryder\\'s and\\nbought what I intended to buy, but not in much perfection. There were\\nno narrow braces for children, and scarcely any notting silk; but Miss\\nWood, as usual, is going to town very soon, and will lay in a fresh\\nstock. I gave 2_s._ 3_d._ a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it is not\\nvery good, but it is so disgraceful and contemptible an article in\\nitself that its being comparatively good or bad is of little importance.\\nI bought some Japan ink likewise, and next week shall begin my\\noperations on my hat, on which you know my principal hopes of happiness\\ndepend.\\n\\nI am very grand indeed; I had the dignity of dropping out my mother\\'s\\nlaudanum last night. I carry about the keys of the wine and closet, and\\ntwice since I began this letter have had orders to give in the kitchen.\\nOur dinner was very good yesterday, and the chicken boiled perfectly\\ntender; therefore I shall not be obliged to dismiss Nanny on that\\naccount.\\n\\nAlmost everything was unpacked and put away last night. Nanny chose to\\ndo it, and I was not sorry to be busy. I have unpacked the gloves, and\\nplaced yours in your drawer. Their color is light and pretty, and I\\nbelieve exactly what we fixed on.\\n\\nYour letter was chaperoned here by one from Mrs. Cooke, in which she\\nsays that \"Battleridge\" is not to come out before January, and she is so\\nlittle satisfied with Cawthorn\\'s dilatoriness that she never means to\\nemploy him again.\\n\\nMrs. Hall, of Sherborne, was brought to bed yesterday of a dead child,\\nsome weeks before she expected, owing to a fright. I suppose she\\nhappened unawares to look at her husband.\\n\\nThere has been a great deal of rain here for this last fortnight, much\\nmore than in Kent, and indeed we found the roads all the way from\\nStaines most disgracefully dirty. Steventon lane has its full share of\\nit, and I don\\'t know when I shall be able to get to Deane.\\n\\nI hear that Martha is in better looks and spirits than she has enjoyed\\nfor a long time, and I flatter myself she will now be able to jest\\nopenly about Mr. W.\\n\\nThe spectacles which Molly found are my mother\\'s, the scissors my\\nfather\\'s. We are very glad to hear such a good account of your patients,\\nlittle and great. My dear itty Dordy\\'s remembrance of me is very\\npleasing to me,--foolishly pleasing, because I know it will be over so\\nsoon. My attachment to him will be more durable. I shall think with\\ntenderness and delight on his beautiful and smiling countenance and\\ninteresting manner until a few years have turned him into an\\nungovernable, ungracious fellow.\\n\\nThe books from Winton are all unpacked and put away; the binding has\\ncompressed them most conveniently, and there is now very good room in\\nthe bookcase for all that we wish to have there. I believe the servants\\nwere very glad to see us Nanny was, I am sure. She confesses that it\\nwas very dull, and yet she had her child with her till last Sunday. I\\nunderstand that there are some grapes left, but I believe not many; they\\nmust be gathered as soon as possible, or this rain will entirely rot\\nthem.\\n\\nI am quite angry with myself for not writing closer; why is my alphabet\\nso much more sprawly than yours? Dame Tilbury\\'s daughter has lain in.\\nShall I give her any of your baby clothes? The laceman was here only a\\nfew days ago. How unfortunate for both of us that he came so soon! Dame\\nBushell washes for us only one week more, as Sukey has got a place. John\\nSteevens\\' wife undertakes our purification. She does not look as if\\nanything she touched would ever be clean, but who knows? We do not seem\\nlikely to have any other maidservant at present, but Dame Staples will\\nsupply the place of one. Mary has hired a young girl from Ashe who has\\nnever been out to service to be her scrub, but James fears her not being\\nstrong enough for the place.\\n\\nEarle Harwood has been to Deane lately, as I think Mary wrote us word,\\nand his family then told him that they would receive his wife, if she\\ncontinued to behave well for another year. He was very grateful, as well\\nhe might; their behavior throughout the whole affair has been\\nparticularly kind. Earle and his wife live in the most private manner\\nimaginable at Portsmouth, without keeping a servant of any kind. What a\\nprodigious innate love of virtue she must have, to marry under such\\ncircumstances!\\n\\nIt is now Saturday evening, but I wrote the chief of this in the\\nmorning. My mother has not been down at all to-day; the laudanum made\\nher sleep a good deal, and upon the whole I think she is better. My\\nfather and I dined by ourselves. How strange! He and John Bond are now\\nvery happy together, for I have just heard the heavy step of the latter\\nalong the passage.\\n\\nJames Digweed called to-day, and I gave him his brother\\'s deputation.\\nCharles Harwood, too, has just called to ask how we are, in his way from\\nDummer, whither he has been conveying Miss Garrett, who is going to\\nreturn to her former residence in Kent. I will leave off, or I shall not\\nhave room to add a word to-morrow.\\n\\n_Sunday._--My mother has had a very good night, and feels much better\\nto-day.\\n\\nI have received my aunt\\'s letter, and thank you for your scrap. I will\\nwrite to Charles soon. Pray give Fanny and Edward a kiss from me, and\\nask George if he has got a new song for me. \\'Tis really very kind of my\\naunt to ask us to Bath again; a kindness that deserves a better return\\nthan to profit by it.\\n\\n                                                 Yours ever,      J.

       "  'text': 'STEVENTON, December 1.\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I am so good as to write to you again thus speedily,\\nto let you know that I have just heard from Frank. He was at Cadiz,\\nalive and well, on October 19, and had then very lately received a\\nletter from you, written as long ago as when the \"London\" was at St.\\nHelen\\'s. But his _raly_ latest intelligence of us was in one from me of\\nSeptember 1, which I sent soon after we got to Godmersham. He had\\nwritten a packet full for his dearest friends in England, early in\\nOctober, to go by the \"Excellent;\" but the \"Excellent\" was not sailed,\\nnor likely to sail, when he despatched this to me. It comprehended\\nletters for both of us, for Lord Spencer, Mr. Daysh, and the East India\\nDirectors. Lord St. Vincent had left the fleet when he wrote, and was\\ngone to Gibraltar, it was said to superintend the fitting out of a\\nprivate expedition from thence against some of the enemies\\' ports;\\nMinorca or Malta were conjectured to be the objects.\\n\\nFrank writes in good spirits, but says that our correspondence cannot be\\nso easily carried on in future as it has been, as the communication\\nbetween Cadiz and Lisbon is less frequent than formerly. You and my\\nmother, therefore, must not alarm yourselves at the long intervals that\\nmay divide his letters. I address this advice to you two as being the\\nmost tender-hearted of the family.\\n\\nMy mother made her _entrée_ into the dressing-room through crowds of\\nadmiring spectators yesterday afternoon, and we all drank tea together\\nfor the first time these five weeks. She has had a tolerable night, and\\nbids fair for a continuance in the same brilliant course of action\\nto-day. . . .\\n\\nMr. Lyford was here yesterday; he came while we were at dinner, and\\npartook of our elegant entertainment. I was not ashamed at asking him to\\nsit down to table, for we had some pease-soup, a sparerib, and a\\npudding. He wants my mother to look yellow and to throw out a rash, but\\nshe will do neither.\\n\\nI was at Deane yesterday morning. Mary was very well, but does not gain\\nbodily strength very fast. When I saw her so stout on the third and\\nsixth days, I expected to have seen her as well as ever by the end of a\\nfortnight.\\n\\nJames went to Ibthorp yesterday to see his mother and child. Letty is\\nwith Mary[3] at present, of course exceedingly happy, and in raptures\\nwith the child. Mary does not manage matters in such a way as to make me\\nwant to lay in myself. She is not tidy enough in her appearance; she has\\nno dressing-gown to sit up in; her curtains are all too thin, and\\nthings are not in that comfort and style about her which are necessary\\nto make such a situation an enviable one. Elizabeth was really a pretty\\nobject with her nice clean cap put on so tidily and her dress so\\nuniformly white and orderly. We live entirely in the dressing-room now,\\nwhich I like very much; I always feel so much more elegant in it than in\\nthe parlor.\\n\\nNo news from Kintbury yet. Eliza sports with our impatience. She was\\nvery well last Thursday. Who is Miss Maria Montresor going to marry, and\\nwhat is to become of Miss Mulcaster?\\n\\nI find great comfort in my stuff gown, but I hope you do not wear yours\\ntoo often. I have made myself two or three caps to wear of evenings\\nsince I came home, and they save me a world of torment as to\\nhairdressing, which at present gives me no trouble beyond washing and\\nbrushing, for my long hair is always plaited up out of sight, and my\\nshort hair curls well enough to want no papering. I have had it cut\\nlately by Mr. Butler.\\n\\nThere is no reason to suppose that Miss Morgan is dead after all. Mr.\\nLyford gratified us very much yesterday by his praises of my father\\'s\\nmutton, which they all think the finest that was ever ate. John Bond\\nbegins to find himself grow old, which John Bonds ought not to do, and\\nunequal to much hard work; a man is therefore hired to supply his place\\nas to labor, and John himself is to have the care of the sheep. There\\nare not more people engaged than before, I believe; only men instead of\\nboys. I fancy so at least, but you know my stupidity as to such matters.\\nLizzie Bond is just apprenticed to Miss Small, so we may hope to see her\\nable to spoil gowns in a few years.\\n\\nMy father has applied to Mr. May for an ale-house for Robert, at his\\nrequest, and to Mr. Deane, of Winchester, likewise. This was my mother\\'s\\nidea, who thought he would be proud to oblige a relation of Edward in\\nreturn for Edward\\'s accepting his money. He sent a very civil answer\\nindeed, but has no house vacant at present. May expects to have an empty\\none soon at Farnham, so perhaps Nanny may have the honor of drawing ale\\nfor the Bishop. I shall write to Frank to-morrow.\\n\\nCharles Powlett gave a dance on Thursday, to the great disturbance of\\nall his neighbors, of course, who, you know, take a most lively interest\\nin the state of his finances, and live in hopes of his being soon\\nruined.\\n\\nWe are very much disposed to like our new maid; she knows nothing of a\\ndairy, to be sure, which, in our family, is rather against her, but she\\nis to be taught it all. In short, we have felt the inconvenience of\\nbeing without a maid so long, that we are determined to like her, and\\nshe will find it a hard matter to displease us. As yet, she seems to\\ncook very well, is uncommonly stout, and says she can work well at her\\nneedle.\\n\\n_Sunday._--My father is glad to hear so good an account of Edward\\'s\\npigs, and desires he may be told, as encouragement to his taste for\\nthem, that Lord Bolton is particularly curious in _his_ pigs, has had\\npigstyes of a most elegant construction built for them, and visits them\\nevery morning as soon as he rises.\\n\\n                                             Affectionately yours,\\n                                                                 J.

With regard to your son now in the \\'London\\' I\\nam glad I can give you the assurance that his promotion is likely to\\ntake place very soon, as Lord Spencer has been so good as to say he\\nwould include him in an arrangement that he proposes making in a short\\ntime relative to some promotions in that quarter.\"\\n\\nThere! I may now finish my letter and go and hang myself, for I am sure\\nI can neither write nor do anything which will not appear insipid to you\\nafter this. _Now_ I really think he will soon be made, and only wish we\\ncould communicate our foreknowledge of the event to him whom it\\nprincipally concerns. My father has written to Daysh to desire that he\\nwill inform us, if he can, when the commission is sent. Your chief wish\\nis now ready to be accomplished; and could Lord Spencer give happiness\\nto Martha at the same time, what a joyful heart he would make of yours!\\n\\nI have sent the same extract of the sweets of Gambier to Charles, who,\\npoor fellow, though he sinks into nothing but an humble attendant on the\\nhero of the piece, will, I hope, be contented with the prospect held out\\nto him. By what the Admiral says, it appears as if he had been\\ndesignedly kept in the \"Scorpion.\" But I will not torment myself with\\nconjectures and suppositions; facts shall satisfy me.\\n\\nFrank had not heard from any of us for ten weeks when he wrote to me on\\nNovember 12 in consequence of Lord St. Vincent being removed to\\nGibraltar. When his commission is sent, however, it will not be so long\\non its road as our letters, because all the Government despatches are\\nforwarded by land to his lordship from Lisbon with great regularity.\\n\\nI returned from Manydown this morning, and found my mother certainly in\\nno respect worse than when I left her. She does not like the cold\\nweather, but that we cannot help. I spent my time very quietly and very\\npleasantly with Catherine. Miss Blackford is agreeable enough. I do not\\nwant people to be very agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking\\nthem a great deal. I found only Catherine and her when I got to Manydown\\non Thursday. We dined together, and went together to Worting to seek the\\nprotection of Mrs. Clarke, with whom were Lady Mildmay, her eldest son,\\nand Mr. and Mrs. Hoare.\\n\\nOur ball was very thin, but by no means unpleasant. There were\\nthirty-one people, and only eleven ladies out of the number, and but\\nfive single women in the room. Of the gentlemen present you may have\\nsome idea from the list of my partners,--Mr. Wood, G. Lefroy, Rice, a\\nMr. Butcher (belonging to the Temples, a sailor and not of the 11th\\nLight Dragoons), Mr. Temple (not the horrid one of all), Mr. Wm. Orde\\n(cousin to the Kingsclere man), Mr. John Harwood, and Mr. Calland, who\\nappeared as usual with his hat in his hand, and stood every now and then\\nbehind Catherine and me to be talked to and abused for not dancing. We\\nteased him, however, into it at last. I was very glad to see him again\\nafter so long a separation, and he was altogether rather the genius and\\nflirt of the evening. He inquired after you.\\n\\nThere were twenty dances, and I danced them all, and without any\\nfatigue. I was glad to find myself capable of dancing so much, and with\\nso much satisfaction as I did; from my slender enjoyment of the Ashford\\nballs (as assemblies for dancing) I had not thought myself equal to it,\\nbut in cold weather and with few couples I fancy I could just as well\\ndance for a week together as for half an hour. My black cap was openly\\nadmired by Mrs. Lefroy, and secretly I imagine by everybody else in the\\nroom. . . .\\n\\nPoor Edward! It is very hard that he, who has everything else in the\\nworld that he can wish for, should not have good health too. But I hope\\nwith the assistance of stomach complaints, faintnesses, and sicknesses,\\nhe will soon be restored to that blessing likewise. If his nervous\\ncomplaint proceeded from a suppression of something that ought to be\\nthrown out, which does not seem unlikely, the first of these disorders\\nmay really be a remedy, and I sincerely wish it may, for I know no one\\nmore deserving of happiness without alloy than Edward is. . . .\\n\\nThe Lords of the Admiralty will have enough of our applications at\\npresent, for I hear from Charles that he has written to Lord Spencer\\nhimself to be removed. I am afraid his Serene Highness will be in a\\npassion, and order some of our heads to be cut off. . . .\\n\\nYou deserve a longer letter than this; but it is my unhappy fate seldom\\nto treat people so well as they deserve. . . .

I have got over the\\ndreadful epocha of mantua-making much better than I expected. My gown is\\nmade very much like my blue one, which you always told me sat very well,\\nwith only these variations: the sleeves are short, the wrap fuller, the\\napron comes over it, and a band of the same completes the whole.\\n\\nI assure you that I dread the idea of going to Brighton as much as you\\ndo, but I am not without hopes that something may happen to prevent it.\\n\\nF---- has lost his election at B----, and perhaps they may not be able\\nto see company for some time.

My mother\\nhas undertaken to do it for me, and I shall leave the Kempshott ball for\\nher.\\n\\nYou express so little anxiety about my being murdered under Ash Park\\nCopse by Mrs. Hulbert\\'s servant, that I have a great mind not to tell\\nyou whether I was or not, and shall only say that I did not return home\\nthat night or the next, as Martha kindly made room for me in her bed,\\nwhich was the shut-up one in the new nursery. Nurse and the child slept\\nupon the floor, and there we all were in some confusion and great\\ncomfort. The bed did exceedingly well for us, both to lie awake in and\\ntalk till two o\\'clock, and to sleep in the rest of the night.

We all dined at the Harwoods\\' on Thursday, and the party\\nbroke up the next morning.\\n\\nThis complaint in my eye has been a sad bore to me, for I have not been\\nable to read or work in any comfort since Friday; but one advantage\\nwill be derived from it, for I shall be such a proficient in music by\\nthe time I have got rid of my cold, that I shall be perfectly qualified\\nin that science at least to take Mr. Roope\\'s office at Eastwell next\\nsummer; and I am sure of Elizabeth\\'s recommendation, be it only on\\nHarriet\\'s account. Of my talent in drawing I have given specimens in my\\nletters to you, and I have nothing to do but to invent a few hard names\\nfor the stars.\\n\\nMary grows rather more reasonable about her child\\'s beauty, and says\\nthat she does not think him really handsome; but I suspect her\\nmoderation to be something like that of W---- W----\\'s mamma. Perhaps\\nMary has told you that they are going to enter more into dinner-parties;\\nthe Biggs and Mr. Holder dine there to-morrow, and I am to meet them. I\\nshall sleep there.

Blackstone, her two daughters, and me. I do not like\\nthe Miss Blackstones; indeed, I was always determined not to like them,\\nso there is the less merit in it. Mrs. Bramston was very civil, kind,\\nand noisy. I spent a very pleasant evening, chiefly among the Manydown\\nparty. There was the same kind of supper as last year, and the same want\\nof chairs. There were more dancers than the room could conveniently\\nhold, which is enough to constitute a good ball at any time.\\n\\nI do not think I was very much in request. People were rather apt not to\\nask me till they could not help it; one\\'s consequence, you know, varies\\nso much at times without any particular reason. There was one gentleman,\\nan officer of the Cheshire, a very good-looking young man, who, I was\\ntold, wanted very much to be introduced to me; but as he did not want\\nit quite enough to take much trouble in effecting it, we never could\\nbring it about.\\n\\nI danced with Mr. John Wood again, twice with a Mr. South, a lad from\\nWinchester, who, I suppose, is as far from being related to the bishop\\nof that diocese as it is possible to be, with G. Lefroy, and J. Harwood,\\nwho, I think, takes to me rather more than he used to do. One of my\\ngayest actions was sitting down two dances in preference to having Lord\\nBolton\\'s eldest son for my partner, who danced too ill to be endured.\\nThe Miss Charterises were there, and played the parts of the Miss Edens\\nwith great spirit. Charles never came. Naughty Charles! I suppose he\\ncould not get superseded in time.\\n\\nMiss Debary has replaced your two sheets of drawing-paper with two of\\nsuperior size and quality; so I do not grudge her having taken them at\\nall now. Mr. Ludlow and Miss Pugh of Andover are lately married, and so\\nis Mrs. Skeete of Basingstoke, and Mr. French, chemist, of Reading.\\n\\nI do not wonder at your wanting to read \"First Impressions\" again, so\\nseldom as you have gone through it, and that so long ago. I am much\\nobliged to you for meaning to leave my old petticoat behind you. I have\\nlong secretly wished it might be done, but had not courage to make the\\nrequest.\\n\\nPray mention the name of Maria Montresor\\'s lover when you write next.

I should like to go as\\nfar as Ospringe with him very much indeed, that I might surprise you at\\nGodmersham.\\n\\nMartha writes me word that Charles was very much admired at Kintbury,\\nand Mrs. Lefroy never saw any one so much improved in her life, and\\nthinks him handsomer than Henry. He appears to far more advantage here\\nthan he did at Godmersham, not surrounded by strangers and neither\\noppressed by a pain in his face or powder in his hair.\\n\\nJames christened Elizabeth Caroline on Saturday morning, and then came\\nhome. Mary, Anna, and Edward have left us of course; before the second\\nwent I took down her answer to her cousin Fanny.\\n\\nYesterday came a letter to my mother from Edward Cooper to announce, not\\nthe birth of a child, but of a living; for Mrs. Leigh has begged his\\nacceptance of the Rectory of Hamstall-Ridware in Staffordshire, vacant\\nby Mr. Johnson\\'s death. We collect from his letter that he means to\\nreside there, in which he shows his wisdom. Staffordshire is a good way\\noff; so we shall see nothing more of them till, some fifteen years\\nhence, the Miss Coopers are presented to us, fine, jolly, handsome,\\nignorant girls. The living is valued at 140_l._ a year, but perhaps it\\nmay be improvable. How will they be able to convey the furniture of the\\ndressing-room so far in safety?\\n\\nOur first cousins seem all dropping off very fast. One is incorporated\\ninto the family, another dies, and a third goes into Staffordshire. We\\ncan learn nothing of the disposal of the other living. I have not the\\nsmallest notion of Fulwar\\'s having it. Lord Craven has probably other\\nconnections and more intimate ones, in that line, than he now has with\\nthe Kintbury family.\\n\\nOur ball on Thursday was a very poor one, only eight couple and but\\ntwenty-three people in the room; but it was not the ball\\'s fault, for we\\nwere deprived of two or three families by the sudden illness of Mr.\\nWither, who was seized that morning at Winchester with a return of his\\nformer alarming complaint. An express was sent off from thence to the\\nfamily; Catherine and Miss Blackford were dining with Mrs. Russell. Poor\\nCatherine\\'s distress must have been very great. She was prevailed on to\\nwait till the Heathcotes could come from Wintney, and then with those\\ntwo and Harris proceeded directly to Winchester. In such a disorder his\\ndanger, I suppose, must always be great; but from this attack he is now\\nrapidly recovering, and will be well enough to return to Manydown, I\\nfancy, in a few days.\\n\\nIt was a fine thing for conversation at the ball. But it deprived us not\\nonly of the Biggs, but of Mrs. Russell too, and of the Boltons and John\\nHarwood, who were dining there likewise, and of Mr. Lane, who kept away\\nas related to the family. Poor man!--I mean Mr. Wither--his life is so\\nuseful, his character so respectable and worthy, that I really believe\\nthere was a good deal of sincerity in the general concern expressed on\\nhis account.\\n\\nOur ball was chiefly made up of Jervoises and Terrys, the former of whom\\nwere apt to be vulgar, the latter to be noisy. I had an odd set of\\npartners: Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Street, Colonel Jervoise, James Digweed, J.\\nLyford, and Mr. Briggs, a friend of the latter. I had a very pleasant\\nevening, however, though you will probably find out that there was no\\nparticular reason for it; but I do not think it worth while to wait for\\nenjoyment until there is some real opportunity for it. Mary behaved very\\nwell, and was not at all fidgetty. For the history of her adventures at\\nthe ball I refer you to Anna\\'s letter.\\n\\nWhen you come home you will have some shirts to make up for Charles.\\nMrs. Davies frightened him into buying a piece of Irish when we were in\\nBasingstoke. Mr. Daysh supposes that Captain Austen\\'s commission has\\nreached him by this time.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--Your letter has pleased and amused me very much. Your essay\\non happy fortnights is highly ingenious, and the talobert skin made me\\nlaugh a good deal. Whenever I fall into misfortune, how many jokes it\\nought to furnish to my acquaintance in general, or I shall die\\ndreadfully in their debt for entertainment.\\n\\nIt began to occur to me before you mentioned it that I had been\\nsomewhat silent as to my mother\\'s health for some time, but I thought\\nyou could have no difficulty in divining its exact state,--you, who have\\nguessed so much stranger things. She is tolerably well,--better upon the\\nwhole than she was some weeks ago. She would tell you herself that she\\nhas a very dreadful cold in her head at present; but I have not much\\ncompassion for colds in the head without fever or sore throat.\\n\\nOur own particular little brother got a place in the coach last night,\\nand is now, I suppose, in town. I have no objection at all to your\\nbuying our gowns there, as your imagination has pictured to you exactly\\nsuch a one as is necessary to make me happy. You quite abash me by your\\nprogress in notting, for I am still without silk. You must get me some\\nin town or in Canterbury; it should be finer than yours.\\n\\nI thought Edward would not approve of Charles being a crop, and rather\\nwished you to conceal it from him at present, lest it might fall on his\\nspirits and retard his recovery. My father furnishes him with a pig from\\nCheesedown; it is already killed and cut up, but it is not to weigh more\\nthan nine stone; the season is too far advanced to get him a larger one.\\nMy mother means to pay herself for the salt and the trouble of ordering\\nit to be cured by the spareribs, the souse, and the lard. We have had\\none dead lamb.\\n\\nI congratulate you on Mr. E. Hatton\\'s good fortune. I suppose the\\nmarriage will now follow out of hand. Give my compliments to Miss Finch.\\n\\nWhat time in March may we expect your return in? I begin to be very\\ntired of answering people\\'s questions on that subject, and independent\\nof that, I shall be very glad to see you at home again, and then if we\\ncan get Martha and shirk . . . who will be so happy as we?\\n\\nI think of going to Ibthorp in about a fortnight. My eyes are pretty\\nwell, I thank you, if you please.\\n\\n_Wednesday, 23d._--I wish my dear Fanny many returns of this day, and\\nthat she may on every return enjoy as much pleasure as she is now\\nreceiving from her doll\\'s-beds.\\n\\nI have just heard from Charles, who is by this time at Deal. He is to be\\nsecond lieutenant, which pleases him very well. The \"Endymion\" is come\\ninto the Downs, which pleases him likewise. He expects to be ordered to\\nSheerness shortly, as the \"Tamar\" has never been refitted.\\n\\nMy father and mother made the same match for you last night, and are\\nvery much pleased with it. _He_ is a beauty of my mother\\'s.\\n\\n                                            Yours affectionately,\\n                                                               JANE.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"13 QUEEN'S SQUARE, Friday (May 17).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Our journey yesterday went off exceedingly well;\\nnothing occurred to alarm or delay us. We found the roads in excellent\\norder, had very good horses all the way, and reached Devizes with ease\\nby four o'clock. I suppose John has told you in what manner we were\\ndivided when we left Andover, and no alteration was afterwards made. At\\nDevizes we had comfortable rooms and a good dinner, to which we sat down\\nabout five; amongst other things we had asparagus and a lobster, which\\nmade me wish for you, and some cheesecakes, on which the children made\\nso delightful a supper as to endear the town of Devizes to them for a\\nlong time.\\n\\nWell, here we are at Bath; we got here about one o'clock, and have been\\narrived just long enough to go over the house, fix on our rooms, and be\\nvery well pleased with the whole of it. Poor Elizabeth has had a dismal\\nride of it from Devizes, for it has rained almost all the way, and our\\nfirst view of Bath has been just as gloomy as it was last November\\ntwelvemonth.\\n\\nI have got so many things to say, so many things equally important, that\\nI know not on which to decide at present, and shall therefore go and eat\\nwith the children.\\n\\nWe stopped in Paragon as we came along, but as it was too wet and dirty\\nfor us to get out, we could only see Frank, who told us that his master\\nwas very indifferent, but had had a better night last night than usual.\\nIn Paragon we met Mrs. Foley and Mrs. Dowdeswell with her yellow shawl\\nairing out, and at the bottom of Kingsdown Hill we met a gentleman in a\\nbuggy, who, on minute examination, turned out to be Dr. Hall--and Dr.\\nHall in such very deep mourning that either his mother, his wife, or\\nhimself must be dead. These are all of our acquaintance who have yet met\\nour eyes.\\n\\nI have some hopes of being plagued about my trunk; I had more a few\\nhours ago, for it was too heavy to go by the coach which brought Thomas\\nand Rebecca from Devizes; there was reason to suppose that it might be\\ntoo heavy likewise for any other coach, and for a long time we could\\nhear of no wagon to convey it. At last, however, we unluckily discovered\\nthat one was just on the point of setting out for this place, but at any\\nrate the trunk cannot be here till to-morrow; so far we are safe, and\\nwho knows what may not happen to procure a further delay?\\n\\nI put Mary's letter into the post-office at Andover with my own hand.\\n\\nWe are exceedingly pleased with the house; the rooms are quite as large\\nas we expected. Mrs. Bromley is a fat woman in mourning, and a little\\nblack kitten runs about the staircase. Elizabeth has the apartment\\nwithin the drawing-room; she wanted my mother to have it, but as there\\nwas no bed in the inner one, and the stairs are so much easier of\\nascent, or my mother so much stronger than in Paragon as not to regard\\nthe double flight, it is settled for us to be above, where we have two\\nvery nice-sized rooms, with dirty quilts and everything comfortable. I\\nhave the outward and larger apartment, as I ought to have; which is\\nquite as large as our bedroom at home, and my mother's is not materially\\nless. The beds are both as large as any at Steventon, and I have a very\\nnice chest of drawers and a closet full of shelves,--so full indeed that\\nthere is nothing else in it, and it should therefore be called a\\ncupboard rather than a closet, I suppose.\\n\\nTell Mary that there were some carpenters at work in the inn at Devizes\\nthis morning, but as I could not be sure of their being Mrs. W. Fowle's\\nrelations, I did not make myself known to them.\\n\\nI hope it will be a tolerable afternoon. When first we came, all the\\numbrellas were up, but now the pavements are getting very white again.\\n\\nMy mother does not seem at all the worse for her journey, nor are any of\\nus, I hope, though Edward seemed rather fagged last night, and not very\\nbrisk this morning; but I trust the bustle of sending for tea, coffee,\\nand sugar, etc., and going out to taste a cheese himself, will do him\\ngood.\\n\\nThere was a very long list of arrivals here in the newspaper yesterday,\\nso that we need not immediately dread absolute solitude; and there is a\\npublic breakfast in Sydney Gardens every morning, so that we shall not\\nbe wholly starved.\\n\\nElizabeth has just had a very good account of the three little boys. I\\nhope you are very busy and very comfortable. I find no difficulty in\\nclosing my eyes. I like our situation very much; it is far more cheerful\\nthan Paragon, and the prospect from the drawing-room window, at which I\\nnow write, is rather picturesque, as it commands a prospective view of\\nthe left side of Brock Street, broken by three Lombardy poplars in the\\ngarden of the last house in Queen's Parade.\\n\\nI am rather impatient to know the fate of my best gown, but I suppose it\\nwill be some days before Frances can get through the trunk. In the mean\\ntime I am, with many thanks for your trouble in making it, as well as\\nmarking my silk stockings,\\n\\n                                    Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                            JANE.\\n\\nA great deal of love from everybody.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon, Overton, Hants.\"},\n",

As I have written to her since the time which\\nought to have brought me hers, I suppose she will consider herself, as I\\nchoose to consider her, still in my debt.\\n\\nI will lay out all the little judgment I have in endeavoring to get such\\nstockings for Anna as she will approve; but I do not know that I shall\\nexecute Martha\\'s commission at all, for I am not fond of ordering shoes;\\nand, at any rate, they shall all have flat heels.\\n\\nWhat must I tell you of Edward? Truth or falsehood? I will try the\\nformer, and you may choose for yourself another time. He was better\\nyesterday than he had been for two or three days before,--about as well\\nas while he was at Steventon. He drinks at the Hetling Pump, is to bathe\\nto-morrow, and try electricity on Tuesday. He proposed the latter\\nhimself to Dr. Fellowes, who made no objection to it, but I fancy we are\\nall unanimous in expecting no advantage from it. At present I have no\\ngreat notion of our staying here beyond the month.\\n\\nI heard from Charles last week; they were to sail on Wednesday.\\n\\nMy mother seems remarkably well. My uncle overwalked himself at first,\\nand can now only travel in a chair, but is otherwise very well.\\n\\nMy cloak is come home. I like it very much, and can now exclaim with\\ndelight, like J. Bond at hay-harvest, \"This is what I have been looking\\nfor these three years.\" I saw some gauzes in a shop in Bath Street\\nyesterday at only 4_d._ a yard, but they were not so good or so pretty\\nas mine. Flowers are very much worn, and fruit is still more the thing.\\nElizabeth has a bunch of strawberries, and I have seen grapes, cherries,\\nplums, and apricots. There are likewise almonds and raisins, French\\nplums, and tamarinds at the grocers\\', but I have never seen any of them\\nin hats. A plum or greengage would cost three shillings; cherries and\\ngrapes about five, I believe, but this is at some of the dearest shops.\\nMy aunt has told me of a very cheap one, near Walcot Church, to which I\\nshall go in quest of something for you. I have never seen an old woman\\nat the pump-room.\\n\\nElizabeth has given me a hat, and it is not only a pretty hat, but a\\npretty style of hat too. It is something like Eliza\\'s, only, instead of\\nbeing all straw, half of it is narrow purple ribbon. I flatter myself,\\nhowever, that you can understand very little of it from this\\ndescription. Heaven forbid that I should ever offer such encouragement\\nto explanations as to give a clear one on any occasion myself! But I\\nmust write no more of this. . . .\\n\\nI spent Friday evening with the Mapletons, and was obliged to submit to\\nbeing pleased in spite of my inclination. We took a very charming walk\\nfrom six to eight up Beacon Hill, and across some fields, to the village\\nof Charlecombe, which is sweetly situated in a little green valley, as a\\nvillage with such a name ought to be. Marianne is sensible and\\nintelligent; and even Jane, considering how fair she is, is not\\nunpleasant. We had a Miss North and a Mr. Gould of our party; the latter\\nwalked home with me after tea. He is a very young man, just entered\\nOxford, wears spectacles, and has heard that \"Evelina\" was written by\\nDr. Johnson.\\n\\nI am afraid I cannot undertake to carry Martha\\'s shoes home, for, though\\nwe had plenty of room in our trunks when we came, we shall have many\\nmore things to take back, and I must allow besides for my packing.\\n\\nThere is to be a grand gala on Tuesday evening in Sydney Gardens, a\\nconcert, with illuminations and fireworks. To the latter Elizabeth and I\\nlook forward with pleasure, and even the concert will have more than\\nits usual charm for me, as the gardens are large enough for me to get\\npretty well beyond the reach of its sound. In the morning Lady\\nWilloughby is to present the colors to some corps, or Yeomanry, or\\nother, in the Crescent, and that such festivities may have a proper\\ncommencement, we think of going to. . . .\\n\\nI am quite pleased with Martha and Mrs. Lefroy for wanting the pattern\\nof our caps, but I am not so well pleased with your giving it to them.\\nSome wish, some prevailing wish, is necessary to the animation of\\neverybody\\'s mind, and in gratifying this you leave them to form some\\nother which will not probably be half so innocent. I shall not forget to\\nwrite to Frank. Duty and love, etc.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\n\\nMy uncle is quite surprised at my hearing from you so often; but as long\\nas we can keep the frequency of our correspondence from Martha\\'s uncle,\\nwe will not fear our own.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Steventon.'},\n",

       "  'text': '13 QUEEN SQUARE, Tuesday (June 11).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Your letter yesterday made me very happy. I am\\nheartily glad that you have escaped any share in the impurities of\\nDeane, and not sorry, as it turns out, that our stay here has been\\nlengthened. I feel tolerably secure of our getting away next week,\\nthough it is certainly possible that we may remain till Thursday the\\n27th. I wonder what we shall do with all our intended visits this\\nsummer! I should like to make a compromise with Adlestrop, Harden, and\\nBookham, that Martha\\'s spending the summer at Steventon should be\\nconsidered as our respective visits to them all.\\n\\nEdward has been pretty well for this last week, and as the waters have\\nnever disagreed with him in any respect, we are inclined to hope that he\\nwill derive advantage from them in the end. Everybody encourages us in\\nthis expectation, for they all say that the effect of the waters cannot\\nbe negative, and many are the instances in which their benefit is felt\\nafterwards more than on the spot. He is more comfortable here than I\\nthought he would be, and so is Elizabeth, though they will both, I\\nbelieve, be very glad to get away--the latter especially, which one\\ncan\\'t wonder at somehow. So much for Mrs. Piozzi. I had some thoughts of\\nwriting the whole of my letter in her style, but I believe I shall not.\\n\\nThough you have given me unlimited powers concerning your sprig, I\\ncannot determine what to do about it, and shall therefore in this and in\\nevery other future letter continue to ask your further directions. We\\nhave been to the cheap shop, and very cheap we found it, but there are\\nonly flowers made there, no fruit; and as I could get four or five very\\npretty sprigs of the former for the same money which would procure only\\none Orleans plum--in short, could get more for three or four shillings\\nthan I could have means of bringing home--I cannot decide on the fruit\\ntill I hear from you again. Besides, I cannot help thinking that it is\\nmore natural to have flowers grow out of the head than fruit. What do\\nyou think on that subject?\\n\\nI would not let Martha read \"First Impressions\"[4] again upon any\\naccount, and am very glad that I did not leave it in your power. She is\\nvery cunning, but I saw through her design; she means to publish it from\\nmemory, and one more perusal must enable her to do it. As for\\n\"Fitzalbini,\" when I get home she shall have it, as soon as ever she\\nwill own that Mr. Elliott is handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair men are\\npreferable to black; for I mean to take every opportunity of rooting out\\nher prejudices.\\n\\nBenjamin Portal is here. How charming that is! I do not exactly know\\nwhy, but the phrase followed so naturally that I could not help putting\\nit down. My mother saw him the other day, but without making herself\\nknown to him.\\n\\nI am very glad you liked my lace, and so are you, and so is Martha, and\\nwe are all glad together. I have got your cloak home, which is quite\\ndelightful,--as delightful at least as half the circumstances which are\\ncalled so.\\n\\nI do not know what is the matter with me to-day, but I cannot write\\nquietly; I am always wandering away into some exclamation or other.\\nFortunately I have nothing very particular to say.\\n\\nWe walked to Weston one evening last week, and liked it very much. Liked\\nwhat very much? Weston? No, walking to Weston. I have not expressed\\nmyself properly, but I hope you will understand me.\\n\\nWe have not been to any public place lately, nor performed anything out\\nof the common daily routine of No. 13 Queen Square, Bath. But to-day we\\nwere to have dashed away at a very extraordinary rate, by dining out,\\nhad it not so happened that we did not go.\\n\\nEdward renewed his acquaintance lately with Mr. Evelyn, who lives in the\\nQueen\\'s Parade, and was invited to a family dinner, which I believe at\\nfirst Elizabeth was rather sorry at his accepting; but yesterday Mrs.\\nEvelyn called on us, and her manners were so pleasing that we liked the\\nidea of going very much. The Biggs would call her a nice woman. But Mr.\\nEvelyn, who was indisposed yesterday, is worse to-day, and we are put\\noff.\\n\\nIt is rather impertinent to suggest any household care to a housekeeper,\\nbut I just venture to say that the coffee-mill will be wanted every day\\nwhile Edward is at Steventon, as he always drinks coffee for breakfast.\\n\\nFanny desires her love to you, her love to grandpapa, her love to Anna,\\nand her love to Hannah; the latter is particularly to be remembered.\\nEdward desires his love to you, to grandpapa, to Anna, to little Edward,\\nto Aunt James and Uncle James, and he hopes all your turkeys and ducks\\nand chicken and guinea fowls are very well; and he wishes you very much\\nto send him a printed letter, and so does Fanny--and they both rather\\nthink they shall answer it. . . .\\n\\nDr. Gardiner was married yesterday to Mrs. Percy and her three\\ndaughters.\\n\\nNow I will give you the history of Mary\\'s veil, in the purchase of which\\nI have so considerably involved you that it is my duty to economize for\\nyou in the flowers. I had no difficulty in getting a muslin veil for\\nhalf a guinea, and not much more in discovering afterwards that the\\nmuslin was thick, dirty, and ragged, and therefore would by no means do\\nfor a united gift. I changed it consequently as soon as I could, and,\\nconsidering what a state my imprudence had reduced me to, I thought\\nmyself lucky in getting a black lace one for sixteen shillings. I hope\\nthe half of that sum will not greatly exceed what you had intended to\\noffer upon the altar of sister-in-law affection.\\n\\n                                      Yours affectionately,      JANE.\\n\\nThey do not seem to trouble you much from Manydown.

About two o\\'clock he walked in on a Gosport hack. His feeling\\nequal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and his feeling no fatigue in it\\na still better. He walked down to Deane to dinner; he danced the whole\\nevening, and to-day is no more tired than a gentleman ought to be.\\n\\nYour desiring to hear from me on Sunday will, perhaps, bring you a more\\nparticular account of the ball than you may care for, because one is\\nprone to think much more of such things the morning after they happen,\\nthan when time has entirely driven them out of one\\'s recollection.\\n\\nIt was a pleasant evening; Charles found it remarkably so, but I cannot\\ntell why, unless the absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience\\nreproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent, was a relief to\\nhim. There were only twelve dances, of which I danced nine, and was\\nmerely prevented from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We\\nbegan at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane before five. There were\\nbut fifty people in the room; very few families indeed from our side of\\nthe county, and not many more from the other. My partners were the two\\nSt. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and a very prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I\\ncalled the last, and whom I liked the best of my little stock.\\n\\nThere were very few beauties, and such as there were were not very\\nhandsome. Miss Iremonger did not look well, and Mrs. Blount was the\\nonly one much admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,\\nwith the same broad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband,\\nand fat neck. The two Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains\\nof the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at Enham eight years ago;\\nthe other is refined into a nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine\\nBigg. I looked at Sir Thomas Champneys, and thought of poor Rosalie; I\\nlooked at his daughter, and thought her a queer animal with a white\\nneck. Mrs. Warren I was constrained to think a very fine young woman,\\nwhich I much regret. She danced away with great activity. Her husband is\\nugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John; but he does not look so\\n_very_ old. The Miss Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with\\nbrown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of nose. The General has\\ngot the gout, and Mrs. Maitland the jaundice. Miss Debary, Susan, and\\nSally, all in black, but without any statues, made their appearance, and\\nI was as civil to them as circumstances would allow me. . . .\\n\\nMary said that I looked very well last night. I wore my aunt\\'s gown and\\nhandkerchief, and my hair was at least tidy, which was all my ambition.\\nI will now have done with the ball, and I will moreover go and dress for\\ndinner. . . .\\n\\nFarewell; Charles sends you his best love, and Edward his worst. If you\\nthink the distinction improper, you may take the worst yourself.

It is to you, very short, written from Larnica in Cyprus, and so\\nlately as October 2. He came from Alexandria, and was to return there in\\nthree or four days, knew nothing of his promotion, and does not write\\nabove twenty lines, from a doubt of the letter\\'s ever reaching you, and\\nan idea of all letters being opened at Vienna. He wrote a few days\\nbefore to you from Alexandria by the \"Mercury,\" sent with despatches to\\nLord Keith. Another letter must be owing to us besides this, one if not\\ntwo; because none of these are to me. Henry comes to-morrow, for one\\nnight only.\\n\\nMy mother has heard from Mrs. E. Leigh.

We plan\\nhaving a steady cook and a young giddy housemaid, with a sedate,\\nmiddle-aged man, who is to undertake the double office of husband to the\\nformer and sweetheart to the latter. No children of course to be allowed\\non either side.\\n\\nYou feel more for John Bond than John Bond deserves. I am sorry to lower\\nhis character, but he is not ashamed to own himself that he has no doubt\\nat all of getting a good place, and that he had even an offer many years\\nago from a Farmer Paine of taking him into his service whenever he might\\nquit my father's.\\n\\nThere are three parts of Bath which we have thought of as likely to have\\nhouses in them,--Westgate Buildings, Charles Street, and some of the\\nshort streets leading from Laura Place or Pulteney Street.\\n\\nWestgate Buildings, though quite in the lower part of the town, are not\\nbadly situated themselves. The street is broad, and has rather a good\\nappearance. Charles Street, however, I think is preferable. The\\nbuildings are new, and its nearness to Kingsmead Fields would be a\\npleasant circumstance. Perhaps you may remember, or perhaps you may\\nforget, that Charles Street leads from the Queen Square Chapel to the\\ntwo Green Park Streets.\\n\\nThe houses in the streets near Laura Place I should expect to be above\\nour price. Gay Street would be too high, except only the lower house on\\nthe left-hand side as you ascend. Towards that my mother has no\\ndisinclination; it used to be lower rented than any other house in the\\nrow, from some inferiority in the apartments. But above all others her\\nwishes are at present fixed on the corner house in Chapel Row, which\\nopens into Prince's Street. Her knowledge of it, however, is confined\\nonly to the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain of its being\\nreally desirable as of its being to be had. In the mean time she assures\\nyou that she will do everything in her power to avoid Trim Street,\\nalthough you have not expressed the fearful presentiment of it which was\\nrather expected.\\n\\nWe know that Mrs. Perrot will want to get us into Oxford Buildings, but\\nwe all unite in particular dislike of that part of the town, and\\ntherefore hope to escape. Upon all these different situations you and\\nEdward may confer together, and your opinion of each will be expected\\nwith eagerness.\\n\\nAs to our pictures, the battle-piece, Mr. Nibbs, Sir William East, and\\nall the old heterogeneous, miscellany, manuscript, Scriptural pieces\\ndispersed over the house, are to be given to James. Your own drawings\\nwill not cease to be your own, and the two paintings on tin will be at\\nyour disposal. My mother says that the French agricultural prints in\\nthe best bedroom were given by Edward to his two sisters. Do you or he\\nknow anything about it?\\n\\nShe has written to my aunt, and we are all impatient for the answer. I\\ndo not know how to give up the idea of our both going to Paragon in May.\\nYour going I consider as indispensably necessary, and I shall not like\\nbeing left behind; there is no place here or hereabouts that I shall\\nwant to be staying at, and though, to be sure, the keep of two will be\\nmore than of one, I will endeavor to make the difference less by\\ndisordering my stomach with Bath buns; and as to the trouble of\\naccommodating us, whether there are one or two, it is much the same.\\n\\nAccording to the first plan, my mother and our two selves are to travel\\ndown together, and my father follow us afterwards in about a fortnight\\nor three weeks. We have promised to spend a couple of days at Ibthorp in\\nour way. We must all meet at Bath, you know, before we set out for the\\nsea, and, everything considered, I think the first plan as good as any.\\n\\nMy father and mother, wisely aware of the difficulty of finding in all\\nBath such a bed as their own, have resolved on taking it with them; all\\nthe beds, indeed, that we shall want are to be removed,--namely, besides\\ntheirs, our own two, the best for a spare one, and two for servants; and\\nthese necessary articles will probably be the only material ones that\\nit would answer to send down. I do not think it will be worth while to\\nremove any of our chests of drawers; we shall be able to get some of a\\nmuch more commodious sort, made of deal, and painted to look very neat;\\nand I flatter myself that for little comforts of all kinds our apartment\\nwill be one of the most complete things of the sort all over Bath,\\nBristol included.\\n\\nWe have thought at times of removing the sideboard, or a Pembroke table,\\nor some other piece of furniture, but, upon the whole, it has ended in\\nthinking that the trouble and risk of the removal would be more than the\\nadvantage of having them at a place where everything may be purchased.\\nPray send your opinion.\\n\\nMartha has as good as promised to come to us again in March. Her spirits\\nare better than they were. . . .\\n\\nMy mother bargains for having no trouble at all in furnishing our house\\nin Bath, and I have engaged for your willingly undertaking to do it all.\\nI get more and more reconciled to the idea of our removal. We have lived\\nlong enough in this neighborhood: the Basingstoke balls are certainly on\\nthe decline, there is something interesting in the bustle of going away,\\nand the prospect of spending future summers by the sea or in Wales is\\nvery delightful. For a time we shall now possess many of the advantages\\nwhich I have often thought of with envy in the wives of sailors or\\nsoldiers. It must not be generally known, however, that I am not\\nsacrificing a great deal in quitting the country, or I can expect to\\ninspire no tenderness, no interest, in those we leave behind. . . .\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,       J.

I believe you are right in proposing to delay\\nthe cambric muslin, and I submit with a kind of voluntary reluctance.\\n\\nMr. Peter Debary has declined Deane curacy; he wishes to be settled near\\nLondon. A foolish reason! as if Deane were not near London in comparison\\nof Exeter or York. Take the whole world through, and he will find many\\nmore places at a greater distance from London than Deane than he will at\\na less. What does he think of Glencoe or Lake Katherine?\\n\\nI feel rather indignant that any possible objection should be raised\\nagainst so valuable a piece of preferment, so delightful a\\nsituation!--that Deane should not be universally allowed to be as near\\nthe metropolis as any other country villages. As this is the case,\\nhowever, as Mr. Peter Debary has shown himself a Peter in the blackest\\nsense of the word, we are obliged to look elsewhere for an heir; and my\\nfather has thought it a necessary compliment to James Digweed to offer\\nthe curacy to him, though without considering it as either a desirable\\nor an eligible situation for him. Unless he is in love with Miss Lyford,\\nI think he had better not be settled exactly in this neighborhood; and\\nunless he is very much in love with her indeed, he is not likely to\\nthink a salary of 50_l._ equal in value or efficiency to one of 75_l._\\n\\nWere you indeed to be considered as one of the fixtures of the\\nhouse!--but you were never actually erected in it either by Mr. Egerton\\nBrydges or Mrs. Lloyd. . . .\\n\\nYou are very kind in planning presents for me to make, and my mother has\\nshown me exactly the same attention; but as I do not choose to have\\ngenerosity dictated to me, I shall not resolve on giving my cabinet to\\nAnna till the first thought of it has been my own.\\n\\nSidmouth is now talked of as our summer abode. Get all the information,\\ntherefore, about it that you can from Mrs. C. Cage.\\n\\nMy father\\'s old ministers are already deserting him to pay their court\\nto his son.

The death of Hugh Capet, which, like\\nthat of Mr. Skipsey, though undesired, was not wholly unexpected, being\\npurposely effected, has made the immediate possession of the mare very\\nconvenient, and everything else I suppose will be seized by degrees in\\nthe same manner.

I cannot recall the past, but you shall not hear from\\nme quite so often in future.\\n\\nYour letter to Mary was duly received before she left Deane with Martha\\nyesterday morning, and it gives us great pleasure to know that the\\nChilham ball was so agreeable, and that you danced four dances with Mr.\\nKemble. Desirable, however, as the latter circumstance was, I cannot\\nhelp wondering at its taking place. Why did you dance four dances with\\nso stupid a man? Why not rather dance two of them with some elegant\\nbrother officer who was struck with your appearance as soon as you\\nentered the room?\\n\\nMartha left you her best love.

We were visited by Miss Lyford\\nand Mr. Bayle. The latter began his operations in the house, but had\\nonly time to finish the four sitting-rooms; the rest is deferred till\\nthe spring is more advanced and the days longer. He took his paper of\\nappraisement away with him, and therefore we only know the estimate he\\nhas made of one or two articles of furniture which my father\\nparticularly inquired into. I understand, however, that he was of\\nopinion that the whole would amount to more than two hundred pounds, and\\nit is not imagined that this will comprehend the brewhouse and many\\nother, etc., etc.\\n\\nMiss Lyford was very pleasant, and gave my mother such an account of the\\nhouses in Westgate Buildings, where Mrs. Lyford lodged four years ago,\\nas made her think of a situation there with great pleasure, but your\\nopposition will be without difficulty decisive, and my father, in\\nparticular, who was very well inclined towards the Row before, has now\\nceased to think of it entirely.

I thank you for writing so much; you must really have\\nsent me the value of two letters in one. We are extremely glad to hear\\nthat Elizabeth is so much better, and hope you will be sensible of still\\nfurther amendment in her when you return from Canterbury.\\n\\nOf your visit there I must now speak \"incessantly;\" it surprises, but\\npleases me more, and I consider it as a very just and honorable\\ndistinction of you, and not less to the credit of Mrs. Knight. I have no\\ndoubt of your spending your time with her most pleasantly in quiet and\\nrational conversation, and am so far from thinking her expectations of\\nyou will be deceived, that my only fear is of your being so agreeable,\\nso much to her taste, as to make her wish to keep you with her forever.\\nIf that should be the case, we must remove to Canterbury, which I should\\nnot like so well as Southampton.\\n\\nWhen you receive this, our guests will be all gone or going; and I shall\\nbe left to the comfortable disposal of my time, to ease of mind from the\\ntorments of rice puddings and apple dumplings, and probably to regret\\nthat I did not take more pains to please them all.\\n\\nMrs. J. Austen has asked me to return with her to Steventon; I need not\\ngive my answer; and she has invited my mother to spend there the time of\\nMrs. F. A.\\'s confinement, which she seems half inclined to do.\\n\\nA few days ago I had a letter from Miss Irvine, and as I was in her\\ndebt, you will guess it to be a remonstrance, not a very severe one,\\nhowever; the first page is in her usual retrospective, jealous,\\ninconsistent style, but the remainder is chatty and harmless. She\\nsupposes my silence may have proceeded from resentment of her not having\\nwritten to inquire particularly after my hooping-cough, etc. She is a\\nfunny one.\\n\\nI have answered her letter, and have endeavored to give something like\\nthe truth with as little incivility as I could, by placing my silence to\\nthe want of subject in the very quiet way in which we live. Phebe has\\nrepented, and stays. I have also written to Charles, and I answered Miss\\nBuller\\'s letter by return of post, as I intended to tell you in my last.\\n\\nTwo or three things I recollected when it was too late, that I might\\nhave told you; one is that the Welbys have lost their eldest son by a\\nputrid fever at Eton, and another that Tom Chute is going to settle in\\nNorfolk.\\n\\nYou have scarcely ever mentioned Lizzy since your being at Godmersham. I\\nhope it is not because she is altered for the worse.\\n\\nI cannot yet satisfy Fanny as to Mrs. Foote\\'s baby\\'s name, and I must\\nnot encourage her to expect a good one, as Captain Foote is a professed\\nadversary to all but the plainest; he likes only Mary, Elizabeth, Anne,\\netc. Our best chance is of \"Caroline,\" which in compliment to a sister\\nseems the only exception.\\n\\nHe dined with us on Friday, and I fear will not soon venture again, for\\nthe strength of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton, underdone even\\nfor James; and Captain Foote has a particular dislike to underdone\\nmutton; but he was so good-humored and pleasant that I did not much mind\\nhis being starved. He gives us all the most cordial invitation to his\\nhouse in the country, saying just what the Williams ought to say to make\\nus welcome. Of them we have seen nothing since you left us, and we hear\\nthat they are just gone to Bath again, to be out of the way of further\\nalterations at Brooklands.\\n\\nMrs. F. A. has had a very agreeable letter from Mrs. Dickson, who was\\ndelighted with the purse, and desires her not to provide herself with a\\nchristening dress, which is exactly what her young correspondent wanted;\\nand she means to defer making any of the caps as long as she can, in\\nhope of having Mrs. D.\\'s present in time to be serviceable as a pattern.\\nShe desires me to tell you that the gowns were cut out before your\\nletter arrived, but that they are long enough for Caroline. The _Beds_,\\nas I believe they are called, have fallen to Frank\\'s share to continue,\\nand of course are cut out to admiration.\\n\\n\"Alphonsine\" did not do. We were disgusted in twenty pages, as,\\nindependent of a bad translation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a\\npen hitherto so pure; and we changed it for the \"Female Quixote,\" which\\nnow makes our evening amusement; to me a very high one, as I find the\\nwork quite equal to what I remembered it. Mrs. F. A., to whom it is new,\\nenjoys it as one could wish; the other Mary, I believe, has little\\npleasure from that or any other book.\\n\\nMy mother does not seem at all more disappointed than ourselves at the\\ntermination of the family treaty; she thinks less of that just now than\\nof the comfortable state of her own finances, which she finds on closing\\nher year\\'s accounts beyond her expectation, as she begins the new year\\nwith a balance of 30_l._ in her favor; and when she has written her\\nanswer to my aunt, which you know always hangs a little upon her mind,\\nshe will be above the world entirely. You will have a great deal of\\nunreserved discourse with Mrs. K., I dare say, upon this subject, as\\nwell as upon many other of our family matters. Abuse everybody but me.\\n\\n_Thursday._--We expected James yesterday, but he did not come; if he\\ncomes at all now, his visit will be a very short one, as he must return\\nto-morrow, that Ajax and the chair may be sent to Winchester on\\nSaturday. Caroline\\'s new pelisse depended upon her mother\\'s being able\\nor not to come so far in the chair; how the guinea that will be saved by\\nthe same means of return is to be spent I know not. Mrs. J. A. does not\\ntalk much of poverty now, though she has no hope of my brother\\'s being\\nable to buy another horse next summer.\\n\\nTheir scheme against Warwickshire continues, but I doubt the family\\'s\\nbeing at Stoneleigh so early as James says he must go, which is May.\\n\\nMy mother is afraid I have not been explicit enough on the subject of\\nher wealth; she began 1806 with 68_l._ she begins 1807 with 99_l._, and\\nthis after 32_l._ purchase of stock. Frank too has been settling his\\naccounts and making calculations, and each party feels quite equal to\\nour present expenses; but much increase of house-rent would not do for\\neither. Frank limits himself, I believe, to four hundred a year.\\n\\nYou will be surprised to hear that Jenny is not yet come back; we have\\nheard nothing of her since her reaching Itchingswell, and can only\\nsuppose that she must be detained by illness in somebody or other, and\\nthat she has been each day expecting to be able to come on the morrow. I\\nam glad I did not know beforehand that she was to be absent during the\\nwhole or almost the whole of our friends being with us, for though the\\ninconvenience has not been nothing, I should have feared still more.\\nOur dinners have certainly suffered not a little by having only Molly\\'s\\nhead and Molly\\'s hands to conduct them; she fries better than she did,\\nbut not like Jenny.\\n\\nWe did _not_ take our walk on Friday, it was too dirty, nor have we yet\\ndone it; we may perhaps do something like it to-day, as after seeing\\nFrank skate, which he hopes to do in the meadows by the beech, we are to\\ntreat ourselves with a passage over the ferry. It is one of the\\npleasantest frosts I ever knew, so very quiet. I hope it will last some\\ntime longer for Frank\\'s sake, who is quite anxious to get some skating;\\nhe tried yesterday, but it would not do.\\n\\nOur acquaintance increase too fast. He was recognized lately by Admiral\\nBertie, and a few days since arrived the Admiral and his daughter\\nCatherine to wait upon us. There was nothing to like or dislike in\\neither. To the Berties are to be added the Lances, with whose cards we\\nhave been endowed, and whose visit Frank and I returned yesterday. They\\nlive about a mile and three-quarters from S. to the right of the new\\nroad to Portsmouth, and I believe their house is one of those which are\\nto be seen almost anywhere among the woods on the other side of the\\nItchen. It is a handsome building, stands high, and in a very beautiful\\nsituation.\\n\\nWe found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether she boasts any offspring\\nbesides a grand pianoforte did not appear. She was civil and chatty\\nenough, and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance in Southampton,\\nwhich we gratefully declined.\\n\\nI suppose they must be acting by the orders of Mr. Lance of Netherton in\\nthis civility, as there seems no other reason for their coming near us.\\nThey will not come often, I dare say. They live in a handsome style and\\nare rich, and she seemed to like to be rich, and we gave her to\\nunderstand that we were far from being so; she will soon feel therefore\\nthat we are not worth her acquaintance.\\n\\nYou must have heard from Martha by this time. We have had no accounts of\\nKintbury since her letter to me.\\n\\nMrs. F. A. has had one fainting fit lately; it came on as usual after\\neating a hearty dinner, but did not last long.\\n\\nI can recollect nothing more to say. When my letter is gone, I suppose I\\nshall.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      J.

OUR garden is putting in order by a man who bears a remarkably\\ngood character, has a very fine complexion, and asks something less than\\nthe first. The shrubs which border the gravel walk, he says, are only\\nsweetbrier and roses, and the latter of an indifferent sort; we mean to\\nget a few of a better kind, therefore, and at my own particular desire\\nhe procures us some syringas. I could not do without a syringa, for the\\nsake of Cowper\\'s line. We talk also of a laburnum. The border under the\\nterrace wall is clearing away to receive currants and gooseberry bushes,\\nand a spot is found very proper for raspberries.\\n\\nThe alterations and improvements within doors, too, advance very\\nproperly, and the offices will be made very convenient indeed. Our\\ndressing-table is constructing on the spot, out of a large kitchen table\\nbelonging to the house, for doing which we have the permission of Mr.\\nHusket, Lord Lansdown\\'s painter,--domestic painter, I should call him,\\nfor he lives in the castle. Domestic chaplains have given way to this\\nmore necessary office, and I suppose whenever the walls want no touching\\nup he is employed about my lady\\'s face.\\n\\nThe morning was so wet that I was afraid we should not be able to see\\nour little visitor; but Frank, who alone could go to church, called for\\nher after service, and she is now talking away at my side and examining\\nthe treasures of my writing-desk drawers,--very happy, I believe. Not at\\nall shy, of course.

Moral as well as natural\\ndiseases disappear in the progress of time, and new ones take their\\nplace. Shyness and the sweating sickness have given way to confidence\\nand paralytic complaints. . . .\\n\\n_Evening._--Our little visitor has just left us, and left us highly\\npleased with her; she is a nice, natural, open-hearted, affectionate\\ngirl, with all the ready civility which one sees in the best children in\\nthe present day; so unlike anything that I was myself at her age, that I\\nam often all astonishment and shame. Half her time was spent at\\nspillikins, which I consider as a very valuable part of our household\\nfurniture, and as not the least important benefaction from the family of\\nKnight to that of Austen.\\n\\nBut I must tell you a story. Mary has for some time had notice from Mrs.\\nDickson of the intended arrival of a certain Miss Fowler in this place.\\nMiss F. is an intimate friend of Mrs. D., and a good deal known as such\\nto Mary. On Thursday last she called here while we were out. Mary\\nfound, on our return, her card with only her name on it, and she had\\nleft word that she would call again. The particularity of this made us\\ntalk, and, among other conjectures, Frank said in joke, \"I dare say she\\nis staying with the Pearsons.\" The connection of the names struck Mary,\\nand she immediately recollected Miss Fowler\\'s having been very intimate\\nwith persons so called, and, upon putting everything together, we have\\nscarcely a doubt of her being actually staying with the only family in\\nthe place whom we cannot visit.\\n\\nWhat a _contretemps_! in the language of France. What an unluckiness! in\\nthat of Madame Duval. The black gentleman has certainly employed one of\\nhis menial imps to bring about this complete, though trifling mischief.\\nMiss F. has never called again, but we are in daily expectation of it.\\nMiss P. has, of course, given her a proper understanding of the\\nbusiness. It is evident that Miss F. did not expect or wish to have the\\nvisit returned, and Frank is quite as much on his guard for his wife as\\nwe could desire for her sake or our own.\\n\\nWe shall rejoice in being so near Winchester when Edward belongs to it,\\nand can never have our spare bed filled more to our satisfaction than by\\nhim. Does he leave Eltham at Easter?\\n\\nWe are reading \"Clarentine,\" and are surprised to find how foolish it\\nis. I remember liking it much less on a second reading than at the\\nfirst, and it does not bear a third at all. It is full of unnatural\\nconduct and forced difficulties, without striking merit of any kind.\\n\\nMiss Harrison is going into Devonshire, to attend Mrs. Dusantoy, as\\nusual. Miss J. is married to young Mr. G., and is to be very unhappy. He\\nswears, drinks, is cross, jealous, selfish, and brutal. The match makes\\nher family miserable, and has occasioned his being disinherited.\\n\\nThe Browns are added to our list of acquaintance. He commands the Sea\\nFencibles here, under Sir Thomas, and was introduced at his own desire\\nby the latter when we saw him last week. As yet the gentlemen only have\\nvisited, as Mrs. B. is ill; but she is a nice-looking woman, and wears\\none of the prettiest straw bonnets in the place.\\n\\n_Monday._--The garret beds are made, and ours will be finished to-day. I\\nhad hoped it would be finished on Saturday, but neither Mrs. Hall nor\\nJenny was able to give help enough for that, and I have as yet done very\\nlittle, and Mary nothing at all. This week we shall do more, and I\\nshould like to have all the five beds completed by the end of it. There\\nwill then be the window-curtains, sofa-cover, and a carpet to be\\naltered.\\n\\nI should not be surprised if we were to be visited by James again this\\nweek; he gave us reason to expect him soon, and if they go to Eversley\\nhe cannot come next week.\\n\\nThere, I flatter myself I have constructed you a smartish letter,\\nconsidering my want of materials; but, like my dear Dr. Johnson, I\\nbelieve I have dealt more in notions than facts.\\n\\nI hope your cough is gone, and that you are otherwise well, and remain,\\nwith love,\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,      J.

       "  'text': \"GODMERSHAM, Wednesday (June 15, 1808).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Where shall I begin? Which of all my important\\nnothings shall I tell you first? At half after seven yesterday morning\\nHenry saw us into our own carriage, and we drove away from the Bath\\nHotel; which, by the by, had been found most uncomfortable\\nquarters,--very dirty, very noisy, and very ill-provided. James began\\nhis journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles were hot;\\nDeptford Hill brought to my mind our hot journey into Kent fourteen\\nyears ago; but after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the day\\nadvanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford, which we reached within the\\ntwo hours and three-quarters, we went to the Bull, the same inn at\\nwhich we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the present occasion\\nhad about the same bad butter.\\n\\nAt half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling on without any\\nadventure reached Sittingbourne by three. Daniel was watching for us at\\nthe door of the George, and I was acknowledged very kindly by Mr. and\\nMrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted my conversation, while\\nMary went out to buy some gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for\\nSittingbourne; and so off we drove, drove, drove, and by six o'clock\\nwere at Godmersham.\\n\\nOur two brothers were walking before the house as we approached, as\\nnatural as life. Fanny and Lizzy met us in the Hall with a great deal of\\npleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the breakfast-parlor, and\\nthen proceeded to our rooms. Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the\\nYellow room--very literally--for I am writing in it at this moment. It\\nseems odd to me to have such a great place all to myself, and to be at\\nGodmersham without you is also odd.\\n\\nYou are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who came to me as soon as she\\nhad seen her Aunt James to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as\\nenergetic as usual in her longings for you. She is grown both in height\\nand size since last year, but not immoderately, looks very well, and\\nseems as to conduct and manner just what she was and what one could wish\\nher to continue.\\n\\nElizabeth,[5] who was dressing when we arrived, came to me for a minute\\nattended by Marianne, Charles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave\\nme a very affectionate welcome. That I had received such from Edward\\nalso I need not mention; but I do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I\\nnever saw him look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly\\nwell. I cannot praise Elizabeth's looks, but they are probably affected\\nby a cold. Her little namesake has gained in beauty in the last three\\nyears, though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is not quite so\\nlovely as he was. Louisa is much as I expected, and Cassandra I find\\nhandsomer than I expected, though at present disguised by such a violent\\nbreaking-out that she does not come down after dinner. She has charming\\neyes and a nice open countenance, and seems likely to be very lovable.\\nHer size is magnificent.\\n\\nI was agreeably surprised to find Louisa Bridges still here. She looks\\nremarkably well (legacies are very wholesome diet), and is just what she\\nalways was. John is at Sandling. You may fancy our dinner-party\\ntherefore; Fanny, of course, belonging to it, and little Edward, for\\nthat day. He was almost too happy, his happiness at least made him too\\ntalkative.\\n\\nIt has struck ten; I must go to breakfast.\\n\\nSince breakfast I have had a _tête-à-tête_ with Edward in his room; he\\nwanted to know James's plans and mine, and from what his own now are I\\nthink it already nearly certain that I shall return when they do, though\\nnot with them. Edward will be going about the same time to Alton, where\\nhe has business with Mr. Trimmer, and where he means his son should join\\nhim; and I shall probably be his companion to that place, and get on\\nafterwards somehow or other.\\n\\nI should have preferred a rather longer stay here certainly, but there\\nis no prospect of any later conveyance for me, as he does not mean to\\naccompany Edward on his return to Winchester, from a very natural\\nunwillingness to leave Elizabeth at that time. I shall at any rate be\\nglad not to be obliged to be an incumbrance on those who have brought me\\nhere, for, as James has no horse, I must feel in their carriage that I\\nam taking his place. We were rather crowded yesterday, though it does\\nnot become me to say so, as I and my boa were of the party, and it is\\nnot to be supposed but that a child of three years of age was fidgety.\\n\\nI need scarcely beg you to keep all this to yourself, lest it should get\\nround by Anna's means. She is very kindly inquired after by her friends\\nhere, who all regret her not coming with her father and mother.\\n\\nI left Henry, I hope, free from his tiresome complaint, in other\\nrespects well, and thinking with great pleasure of Cheltenham and\\nStoneleigh.\\n\\nThe brewery scheme is quite at an end: at a meeting of the subscribers\\nlast week it was by general, and I believe very hearty, consent\\ndissolved.\\n\\nThe country is very beautiful. I saw as much as ever to admire in my\\nyesterday's journey. . . .\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[5] Mrs. Edward Austen.\"},\n",

For his sake, and as the most acceptable proof of love\\nto the spirit of her departed mother, she will try to be tranquil and\\nresigned. Does she feel you to be a comfort to her, or is she too much\\noverpowered for anything but solitude?\\n\\nYour account of Lizzy is very interesting. Poor child! One must hope the\\nimpression will be strong, and yet one's heart aches for a dejected mind\\nof eight years old.\\n\\nI suppose you see the corpse? How does it appear? We are anxious to be\\nassured that Edward will not attend the funeral, but when it comes to\\nthe point I think he must feel it impossible.\\n\\nYour parcel shall set off on Monday, and I hope the shoes will fit;\\nMartha and I both tried them on. I shall send you such of your mourning\\nas I think most likely to be useful, reserving for myself your stockings\\nand half the velvet, in which selfish arrangement I know I am doing what\\nyou wish.\\n\\nI am to be in bombazeen and crape, according to what we are told is\\nuniversal here, and which agrees with Martha's previous observation. My\\nmourning, however, will not impoverish me, for by having my velvet\\npelisse fresh lined and made up, I am sure I shall have no occasion this\\nwinter for anything new of that sort. I take my cloak for the lining,\\nand shall send yours on the chance of its doing something of the same\\nfor you, though I believe your pelisse is in better repair than mine.\\nOne Miss Baker makes my gown and the other my bonnet, which is to be\\nsilk covered with crape.\\n\\nI have written to Edward Cooper, and hope he will not send one of his\\nletters of cruel comfort to my poor brother: and yesterday I wrote to\\nAlethea Bigg, in reply to a letter from her.

       "  'text': 'CASTLE SQUARE, Monday (October 24).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Edward and George came to us soon after seven on\\nSaturday, very well, but very cold, having by choice travelled on the\\noutside, and with no greatcoat but what Mr. Wise, the coachman,\\ngood-naturedly spared them of his, as they sat by his side. They were so\\nmuch chilled when they arrived, that I was afraid they must have taken\\ncold; but it does not seem at all the case: I never saw them looking\\nbetter.\\n\\nThey behave extremely well in every respect, showing quite as much\\nfeeling as one wishes to see, and on every occasion speaking of their\\nfather with the liveliest affection. His letter was read over by each of\\nthem yesterday, and with many tears; George sobbed aloud, Edward\\'s tears\\ndo not flow so easily; but as far as I can judge they are both very\\nproperly impressed by what has happened. Miss Lloyd, who is a more\\nimpartial judge than I can be, is exceedingly pleased with them.\\n\\nGeorge is almost a new acquaintance to me, and I find him in a different\\nway as engaging as Edward.\\n\\nWe do not want amusement: bilbocatch, at which George is indefatigable,\\nspillikins, paper ships, riddles, conundrums, and cards, with watching\\nthe flow and ebb of the river, and now and then a stroll out, keep us\\nwell employed; and we mean to avail ourselves of our kind papa\\'s\\nconsideration, by not returning to Winchester till quite the evening of\\nWednesday.\\n\\nMrs. J. A. had not time to get them more than one suit of clothes; their\\nothers are making here, and though I do not believe Southampton is\\nfamous for tailoring, I hope it will prove itself better than\\nBasingstoke. Edward has an old black coat, which will save his having a\\nsecond new one; but I find that black pantaloons are considered by them\\nas necessary, and of course one would not have them made uncomfortable\\nby the want of what is usual on such occasions.\\n\\nFanny\\'s letter was received with great pleasure yesterday, and her\\nbrother sends his thanks and will answer it soon. We all saw what she\\nwrote, and were very much pleased with it.\\n\\nTo-morrow I hope to hear from you, and to-morrow we must think of poor\\nCatherine. To-day Lady Bridges is the heroine of our thoughts, and glad\\nshall we be when we can fancy the meeting over. There will then be\\nnothing so very bad for Edward to undergo.\\n\\nThe \"St. Albans,\" I find, sailed on the very day of my letters reaching\\nYarmouth, so that we must not expect an answer at present; we scarcely\\nfeel, however, to be in suspense, or only enough to keep our plans to\\nourselves. We have been obliged to explain them to our young visitors,\\nin consequence of Fanny\\'s letter, but we have not yet mentioned them to\\nSteventon. We are all quite familiarized to the idea ourselves; my\\nmother only wants Mrs. Seward to go out at midsummer.\\n\\nWhat sort of a kitchen garden is there? Mrs. J. A. expresses her fear of\\nour settling in Kent, and, till this proposal was made, we began to look\\nforward to it here; my mother was actually talking of a house at Wye. It\\nwill be best, however, as it is.\\n\\nAnne has just given her mistress warning; she is going to be married; I\\nwish she would stay her year.\\n\\nOn the subject of matrimony, I must notice a wedding in the Salisbury\\npaper, which has amused me very much, Dr. Phillot to Lady Frances St.\\nLawrence. She wanted to have a husband, I suppose, once in her life, and\\nhe a Lady Frances.\\n\\nI hope your sorrowing party were at church yesterday, and have no longer\\nthat to dread. Martha was kept at home by a cold, but I went with my two\\nnephews, and I saw Edward was much affected by the sermon, which,\\nindeed, I could have supposed purposely addressed to the afflicted, if\\nthe text had not naturally come in the course of Dr. Mant\\'s observations\\non the Litany: \\'All that are in danger, necessity, or tribulation,\\' was\\nthe subject of it. The weather did not allow us afterwards to get\\nfarther than the quay, where George was very happy as long as we could\\nstay, flying about from one side to the other, and skipping on board a\\ncollier immediately.\\n\\nIn the evening we had the Psalms and Lessons, and a sermon at home, to\\nwhich they were very attentive; but you will not expect to hear that\\nthey did not return to conundrums the moment it was over. Their aunt has\\nwritten pleasantly of them, which was more than I hoped.\\n\\nWhile I write now, George is most industriously making and naming paper\\nships, at which he afterwards shoots with horse-chestnuts, brought from\\nSteventon on purpose; and Edward equally intent over the \"Lake of\\nKillarney,\" twisting himself about in one of our great chairs.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--Your close-written letter makes me quite ashamed of my wide\\nlines; you have sent me a great deal of matter, most of it very welcome.\\nAs to your lengthened stay, it is no more than I expected, and what must\\nbe, but you cannot suppose I like it.\\n\\nAll that you say of Edward is truly comfortable; I began to fear that\\nwhen the bustle of the first week was over, his spirits might for a time\\nbe more depressed; and perhaps one must still expect something of the\\nkind. If you escape a bilious attack, I shall wonder almost as much as\\nrejoice. I am glad you mentioned where Catherine goes to-day; it is a\\ngood plan, but sensible people may generally be trusted to form such.\\n\\nThe day began cheerfully, but it is not likely to continue what it\\nshould, for them or for us. We had a little water-party yesterday; I and\\nmy two nephews went from the Itchen Ferry up to Northam, where we\\nlanded, looked into the 74, and walked home, and it was so much enjoyed\\nthat I had intended to take them to Netley to-day; the tide is just\\nright for our going immediately after moonshine, but I am afraid there\\nwill be rain; if we cannot get so far, however, we may perhaps go round\\nfrom the ferry to the quay.\\n\\nI had not proposed doing more than cross the Itchen yesterday, but it\\nproved so pleasant, and so much to the satisfaction of all, that when we\\nreached the middle of the stream we agreed to be rowed up the river;\\nboth the boys rowed great part of the way, and their questions and\\nremarks, as well as their enjoyment, were very amusing; George\\'s\\ninquiries were endless, and his eagerness in everything reminds me often\\nof his uncle Henry.\\n\\nOur evening was equally agreeable in its way: I introduced speculation,\\nand it was so much approved that we hardly knew how to leave off.\\n\\nYour idea of an early dinner to-morrow is exactly what we propose, for,\\nafter writing the first part of this letter, it came into my head that\\nat this time of year we have not summer evenings. We shall watch the\\nlight to-day, that we may not give them a dark drive to-morrow.\\n\\nThey send their best love to papa and everybody, with George\\'s thanks\\nfor the letter brought by this post. Martha begs my brother may be\\nassured of her interest in everything relating to him and his family,\\nand of her sincerely partaking our pleasure in the receipt of every good\\naccount from Godmersham.\\n\\nOf Chawton I think I can have nothing more to say, but that everything\\nyou say about it in the letter now before me will, I am sure, as soon as\\nI am able to read it to her, make my mother consider the plan with more\\nand more pleasure. We had formed the same views on H. Digweed\\'s farm.\\n\\nA very kind and feeling letter is arrived to-day from Kintbury. Mrs.\\nFowle\\'s sympathy and solicitude on such an occasion you will be able to\\ndo justice to, and to express it as she wishes to my brother. Concerning\\nyou, she says: \"Cassandra will, I know, excuse my writing to her; it is\\nnot to save myself but her that I omit so doing. Give my best, my\\nkindest love to her, and tell her I feel for her as I know she would for\\nme on the same occasion, and that I most sincerely hope her health will\\nnot suffer.\"\\n\\nWe have just had two hampers of apples from Kintbury, and the floor of\\nour little garret is almost covered.

Now, however, I must\\ngive it, and now perhaps he may be giving it himself; for I am just in\\nthe hateful predicament of being obliged to write what I know will\\nsomehow or other be of no use.\\n\\nHe meant to ask for five days more, and if they were granted, to go down\\nby Thursday night's mail, and spend Friday and Saturday with you; and he\\nconsidered his chance of succeeding by no means bad. I hope it will take\\nplace as he planned, and that your arrangements with Goodnestone may\\nadmit of suitable alteration.\\n\\nYour news of Edward Bridges was quite news, for I have had no letter\\nfrom Wrotham. I wish him happy with all my heart, and hope his choice\\nmay turn out according to his own expectations, and beyond those of his\\nfamily; and I dare say it will. Marriage is a great improver, and in a\\nsimilar situation Harriet may be as amiable as Eleanor. As to money,\\nthat will come, you may be sure, because they cannot do without it. When\\nyou see him again, pray give him our congratulations and best wishes.\\nThis match will certainly set John and Lucy going.\\n\\nThere are six bedchambers at Chawton; Henry wrote to my mother the other\\nday, and luckily mentioned the number, which is just what we wanted to\\nbe assured of. He speaks also of garrets for store-places, one of which\\nshe immediately planned fitting up for Edward's man-servant; and now\\nperhaps it must be for our own; for she is already quite reconciled to\\nour keeping one. The difficulty of doing without one had been thought of\\nbefore. His name shall be Robert, if you please.\\n\\nBefore I can tell you of it, you will have heard that Miss Sawbridge is\\nmarried. It took place, I believe, on Thursday. Mrs. Fowle has for some\\ntime been in the secret, but the neighborhood in general were quite\\nunsuspicious. Mr. Maxwell was tutor to the young Gregorys,--consequently,\\nthey must be one of the happiest couples in the world, and either of\\nthem worthy of envy, for she must be excessively in love, and he mounts\\nfrom nothing to a comfortable home. Martha has heard him very highly\\nspoken of. They continue for the present at Speen Hill.\\n\\nI have a Southampton match to return for your Kentish one, Captain G.\\nHeathcote and Miss A. Lyell. I have it from Alethea, and like it,\\nbecause I had made it before.\\n\\nYes, the Stoneleigh business is concluded, but it was not till yesterday\\nthat my mother was regularly informed of it, though the news had reached\\nus on Monday evening by way of Steventon. My aunt says as little as may\\nbe on the subject by way of information, and nothing at all by way of\\nsatisfaction. She reflects on Mr. T. Leigh's dilatoriness, and looks\\nabout with great diligence and success for inconvenience and evil, among\\nwhich she ingeniously places the danger of her new housemaids catching\\ncold on the outside of the coach, when she goes down to Bath, for a\\ncarriage makes her sick.\\n\\nJohn Binns has been offered their place, but declines it; as she\\nsupposes, because he will not wear a livery. Whatever be the cause, I\\nlike the effect.\\n\\nIn spite of all my mother's long and intimate knowledge of the writer,\\nshe was not up to the expectation of such a letter as this; the\\ndiscontentedness of it shocked and surprised her--but I see nothing in\\nit out of nature, though a sad nature.\\n\\nShe does not forget to wish for Chambers, you may be sure. No\\nparticulars are given, not a word of arrears mentioned, though in her\\nletter to James they were in a general way spoken of. The amount of them\\nis a matter of conjecture, and to my mother a most interesting one; she\\ncannot fix any time for their beginning with any satisfaction to herself\\nbut Mrs. Leigh's death, and Henry's two thousand pounds neither agrees\\nwith that period nor any other. I did not like to own our previous\\ninformation of what was intended last July, and have therefore only said\\nthat if we could see Henry we might hear many particulars, as I had\\nunderstood that some confidential conversation had passed between him\\nand Mr. T. L. at Stoneleigh.\\n\\nWe have been as quiet as usual since Frank and Mary left us; Mr.\\nCriswick called on Martha that very morning on his way home again from\\nPortsmouth, and we have had no visitor since.\\n\\nWe called on the Miss Lyells one day, and heard a good account of Mr.\\nHeathcote's canvass, the success of which, of course, exceeds his\\nexpectations. Alethea in her letter hopes for my interest, which I\\nconclude means Edward's, and I take this opportunity, therefore, of\\nrequesting that he will bring in Mr. Heathcote. Mr. Lane told us\\nyesterday that Mr. H. had behaved very handsomely, and waited on Mr.\\nThistlethwaite, to say that if he (Mr. T.) would stand, he (Mr. H.)\\nwould not oppose him; but Mr. T. declined it, acknowledging himself\\nstill smarting under the payment of late electioneering costs.\\n\\nThe Mrs. Hulberts, we learn from Kintbury, come to Steventon this week,\\nand bring Mary Jane Fowle with them on her way to Mrs. Nune's; she\\nreturns at Christmas with her brother.\\n\\nOur brother we may perhaps see in the course of a few days, and we mean\\nto take the opportunity of his help to go one night to the play. Martha\\nought to see the inside of the theatre once while she lives in\\nSouthampton, and I think she will hardly wish to take a second view.\\n\\nThe furniture of Bellevue is to be sold to-morrow, and we shall take it\\nin our usual walk, if the weather be favorable.\\n\\nHow could you have a wet day on Thursday? With us it was a prince of\\ndays, the most delightful we have had for weeks; soft, bright, with a\\nbrisk wind from the southwest; everybody was out and talking of spring,\\nand Martha and I did not know how to turn back. On Friday evening we had\\nsome very blowing weather,--from six to nine; I think we never heard it\\nworse, even here. And one night we had so much rain that it forced its\\nway again into the store-closet; and though the evil was comparatively\\nslight and the mischief nothing, I had some employment the next day in\\ndrying parcels, etc. I have now moved still more out of the way.\\n\\nMartha sends her best love, and thanks you for admitting her to the\\nknowledge of the pros and cons about Harriet Foote; she has an interest\\nin all such matters. I am also to say that she wants to see you. Mary\\nJane missed her papa and mamma a good deal at first, but now does very\\nwell without them. I am glad to hear of little John's being better, and\\nhope your accounts of Mrs. Knight will also improve. Adieu! remember me\\naffectionately to everybody, and believe me,\\n\\n                                                 Ever yours,      J.

       "  'text': 'CASTLE SQUARE, Friday (December 9).\\n\\nMANY thanks, my dear Cassandra, to you and Mr. Deedes for your joint and\\nagreeable composition, which took me by surprise this morning. He has\\ncertainly great merit as a writer; he does ample justice to his subject,\\nand without being diffuse is clear and correct; and though I do not\\nmean to compare his epistolary powers with yours, or to give him the\\nsame portion of my gratitude, he certainly has a very pleasing way of\\nwinding up a whole, and speeding truth into the world.\\n\\n\"But all this,\" as my dear Mrs. Piozzi says, \"is flight and fancy and\\nnonsense, for my master has his great casks to mind and I have my little\\nchildren.\" It is you, however, in this instance, that have the little\\nchildren, and I that have the great cask, for we are brewing spruce beer\\nagain; but my meaning really is, that I am extremely foolish in writing\\nall this unnecessary stuff when I have so many matters to write about\\nthat my paper will hardly hold it all. Little matters they are, to be\\nsure, but highly important.\\n\\nIn the first place, Miss Curling is actually at Portsmouth, which I was\\nalways in hopes would not happen. I wish her no worse, however, than a\\nlong and happy abode there. Here she would probably be dull, and I am\\nsure she would be troublesome.\\n\\nThe bracelets are in my possession, and everything I could wish them to\\nbe. They came with Martha\\'s pelisse, which likewise gives great\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\nSoon after I had closed my last letter to you we were visited by Mrs.\\nDickens and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bertie, the wife of a lately made\\nAdmiral. Mrs. F. A.,[8] I believe, was their first object, but they put\\nup with us very kindly, and Mrs. D., finding in Miss Lloyd a friend of\\nMrs. Dundas, had another motive for the acquaintance. She seems a really\\nagreeable woman,--that is, her manners are gentle, and she knows a great\\nmany of our connections in West Kent. Mrs. Bertie lives in the Polygon,\\nand was out when we returned her visit, which are her two virtues.\\n\\nA larger circle of acquaintance, and an increase of amusement, is quite\\nin character with our approaching removal. Yes, I mean to go to as many\\nballs as possible, that I may have a good bargain. Everybody is very\\nmuch concerned at our going away, and everybody is acquainted with\\nChawton, and speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village, and everybody\\nknows the house we describe, but nobody fixes on the right.\\n\\nI am very much obliged to Mrs. Knight for such a proof of the interest\\nshe takes in me, and she may depend upon it that I will marry Mr.\\nPapillon, whatever may be his reluctance or my own. I owe her much more\\nthan such a trifling sacrifice.\\n\\nOur ball was rather more amusing than I expected. Martha liked it very\\nmuch, and I did not gape till the last quarter of an hour. It was past\\nnine before we were sent for, and not twelve when we returned. The room\\nwas tolerably full, and there were, perhaps, thirty couple of dancers.\\nThe melancholy part was to see so many dozen young women standing by\\nwithout partners, and each of them with two ugly naked shoulders.\\n\\nIt was the same room in which we danced fifteen years ago. I thought it\\nall over, and in spite of the shame of being so much older, felt with\\nthankfulness that I was quite as happy now as then. We paid an\\nadditional shilling for our tea, which we took as we chose in an\\nadjoining and very comfortable room.\\n\\nThere were only four dances, and it went to my heart that the Miss\\nLances (one of them, too, named Emma) should have partners only for two.\\nYou will not expect to hear that I was asked to dance, but I was--by the\\ngentleman whom we met that Sunday with Captain D\\'Auvergne. We have\\nalways kept up a bowing acquaintance since, and, being pleased with his\\nblack eyes, I spoke to him at the ball, which brought on me this\\ncivility; but I do not know his name, and he seems so little at home in\\nthe English language that I believe his black eyes may be the best of\\nhim. Captain D\\'Auvergne has got a ship.\\n\\nMartha and I made use of the very favorable state of yesterday for\\nwalking, to pay our duty at Chiswell. We found Mrs. Lance at home and\\nalone, and sat out three other ladies who soon came in. We went by the\\nferry, and returned by the bridge, and were scarcely at all fatigued.\\n\\nEdward must have enjoyed the last two days. You, I presume, had a cool\\ndrive to Canterbury. Kitty Foote came on Wednesday; and her evening\\nvisit began early enough for the last part, the apple-pie, of our\\ndinner, for we never dine now till five.\\n\\nYesterday I--or rather, you--had a letter from Nanny Hilliard, the\\nobject of which is that she would be very much obliged to us if we would\\nget Hannah a place. I am sorry that I cannot assist her; if you can, let\\nme know, as I shall not answer the letter immediately. Mr. Sloper is\\nmarried again, not much to Nanny\\'s, or anybody\\'s satisfaction. The lady\\nwas governess to Sir Robert\\'s natural children, and seems to have\\nnothing to recommend her. I do not find, however, that Nanny is likely\\nto lose her place in consequence. She says not a word of what service\\nshe wishes for Hannah, or what Hannah can do; but a nursery, I suppose,\\nor something of that kind, must be the thing.\\n\\nHaving now cleared away my smaller articles of news, I come to a\\ncommunication of some weight; no less than that my uncle and aunt[9] are\\ngoing to allow James 100_l._ a year. We hear of it through Steventon.\\nMary sent us the other day an extract from my aunt\\'s letter on the\\nsubject, in which the donation is made with the greatest kindness, and\\nintended as a compensation for his loss in the conscientious refusal of\\nHampstead living; 100_l._ a year being all that he had at the time\\ncalled its worth, as I find it was always intended at Steventon to\\ndivide the real income with Kintbury.\\n\\nNothing can be more affectionate than my aunt\\'s language in making the\\npresent, and likewise in expressing her hope of their being much more\\ntogether in future than, to her great regret, they have of late years\\nbeen. My expectations for my mother do not rise with this event. We will\\nallow a little more time, however, before we fly out.\\n\\nIf not prevented by parish business, James comes to us on Monday. The\\nMrs. Hulberts and Miss Murden are their guests at present, and likely to\\ncontinue such till Christmas. Anna comes home on the 19th. The hundred a\\nyear begins next Lady-day.\\n\\nI am glad you are to have Henry with you again; with him and the boys\\nyou cannot but have a cheerful, and at times even a merry, Christmas.\\nMartha is so [_MSS. torn_]. . . . We want to be settled at Chawton in time\\nfor Henry to come to us for some shooting in October, at least, or a\\nlittle earlier, and Edward may visit us after taking his boys back to\\nWinchester. Suppose we name the 4th of September. Will not that do?\\n\\nI have but one thing more to tell you. Mrs. Hill called on my mother\\nyesterday while we were gone to Chiswell, and in the course of the\\nvisit asked her whether she knew anything of a clergyman\\'s family of the\\nname of Alford, who had resided in our part of Hampshire. Mrs. Hill had\\nbeen applied to as likely to give some information of them on account of\\ntheir probable vicinity to Dr. Hill\\'s living by a lady, or for a lady,\\nwho had known Mrs. and the two Miss Alfords in Bath, whither they had\\nremoved it seems from Hampshire, and who now wishes to convey to the\\nMiss Alfords some work or trimming which she has been doing for them;\\nbut the mother and daughters have left Bath, and the lady cannot learn\\nwhere they are gone to. While my mother gave us the account, the\\nprobability of its being ourselves occurred to us, and it had previously\\nstruck herself . . . what makes it more likely, and even indispensably\\nto be us, is that she mentioned Mr. Hammond as now having the living or\\ncuracy which the father had had. I cannot think who our kind lady can\\nbe, but I dare say we shall not like the work.\\n\\nDistribute the affectionate love of a heart not so tired as the right\\nhand belonging to it.\\n\\n                              Yours ever sincerely,          J. A.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[8] Frank Austen.\\n\\n[9] Mr. and Mrs. Leigh Perrot.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (December 27).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I can now write at leisure and make the most of my\\nsubjects, which is lucky, as they are not numerous this week.\\n\\nOur house was cleared by half-past eleven on Saturday, and we had the\\nsatisfaction of hearing yesterday that the party reached home in safety\\nsoon after five.\\n\\nI was very glad of your letter this morning; for, my mother taking\\nmedicine, Eliza keeping her bed with a cold, and Choles not coming, made\\nus rather dull and dependent on the post. You tell me much that gives me\\npleasure, but I think not much to answer. I wish I could help you in\\nyour needlework. I have two hands and a new thimble that lead a very\\neasy life.\\n\\nLady Sondes\\' match surprises, but does not offend me; had her first\\nmarriage been of affection, or had there been a grown-up single\\ndaughter, I should not have forgiven her; but I consider everybody as\\nhaving a right to marry once in their lives for love, if they can, and\\nprovided she will now leave off having bad headaches and being pathetic,\\nI can allow her, I can wish her, to be happy.\\n\\nDo not imagine that your picture of your _tête-à-tête_ with Sir B. makes\\nany change in our expectations here; he could not be really reading,\\nthough he held the newspaper in his hand; he was making up his mind to\\nthe deed, and the manner of it. I think you will have a letter from him\\nsoon.\\n\\nI heard from Portsmouth yesterday, and as I am to send them more\\nclothes, they cannot be expecting a very early return to us. Mary\\'s face\\nis pretty well, but she must have suffered a great deal with it; an\\nabscess was formed and opened.\\n\\nOur evening party on Thursday produced nothing more remarkable than Miss\\nMurden\\'s coming too, though she had declined it absolutely in the\\nmorning, and sitting very ungracious and very silent with us from seven\\no\\'clock till half after eleven, for so late was it, owing to the\\nchairmen, before we got rid of them.\\n\\nThe last hour, spent in yawning and shivering in a wide circle round the\\nfire, was dull enough, but the tray had admirable success. The widgeon\\nand the preserved ginger were as delicious as one could wish. But as to\\nour black butter, do not decoy anybody to Southampton by such a lure,\\nfor it is all gone. The first pot was opened when Frank and Mary were\\nhere, and proved not at all what it ought to be; it was neither solid\\nnor entirely sweet, and on seeing it, Eliza remembered that Miss Austen\\nhad said she did not think it had been boiled enough. It was made, you\\nknow, when we were absent. Such being the event of the first pot, I\\nwould not save the second, and we therefore ate it in unpretending\\nprivacy; and though not what it ought to be, part of it was very good.\\n\\nJames means to keep three horses on this increase of income; at present\\nhe has but one. Mary wishes the other two to be fit to carry women, and\\nin the purchase of one Edward will probably be called upon to fulfil his\\npromise to his godson. We have now pretty well ascertained James\\'s\\nincome to be eleven hundred pounds, curate paid, which makes us very\\nhappy,--the ascertainment as well as the income.\\n\\nMary does not talk of the garden; it may well be a disagreeable subject\\nto her, but her husband is persuaded that nothing is wanting to make the\\nfirst new one good but trenching, which is to be done by his own\\nservants and John Bond, by degrees, not at the expense which trenching\\nthe other amounted to.\\n\\nI was happy to hear, chiefly for Anna\\'s sake, that a ball at Manydown\\nwas once more in agitation; it is called a child\\'s ball, and given by\\nMrs. Heathcote to Wm. Such was its beginning at least, but it will\\nprobably swell into something more. Edward was invited during his stay\\nat Manydown, and it is to take place between this and Twelfth-day. Mrs.\\nHulbert has taken Anna a pair of white shoes on the occasion.\\n\\nI forgot in my last to tell you that we hear, by way of Kintbury and the\\nPalmers, that they were all well at Bermuda in the beginning of Nov.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--Yesterday must have been a day of sad remembrance at\\nGm.[10] I am glad it is over. We spent Friday evening with our friends at\\nthe boarding-house, and our curiosity was gratified by the sight of\\ntheir fellow-inmates, Mrs. Drew and Miss Hook, Mr. Wynne and Mr.\\nFitzhugh; the latter is brother to Mrs. Lance, and very much the\\ngentleman. He has lived in that house more than twenty years, and, poor\\nman! is so totally deaf that they say he could not hear a cannon, were\\nit fired close to him; having no cannon at hand to make the experiment,\\nI took it for granted, and talked to him a little with my fingers, which\\nwas funny enough. I recommended him to read \"Corinna.\"\\n\\nMiss Hook is a well-behaved, genteelish woman; Mrs. Drew well behaved,\\nwithout being at all genteel. Mr. Wynne seems a chatty and rather\\nfamiliar young man. Miss Murden was quite a different creature this last\\nevening from what she had been before, owing to her having with Martha\\'s\\nhelp found a situation in the morning, which bids very fair for comfort.\\nWhen she leaves Steventon, she comes to board and lodge with Mrs.\\nHookey, the chemist--for there is no Mr. Hookey. I cannot say that I am\\nin any hurry for the conclusion of her present visit, but I was truly\\nglad to see her comfortable in mind and spirits; at her age, perhaps,\\none may be as friendless oneself, and in similar circumstances quite as\\ncaptious.\\n\\nMy mother has been lately adding to her possessions in plate,--a whole\\ntablespoon and a whole dessert-spoon, and six whole teaspoons,--which\\nmakes our sideboard border on the magnificent. They were mostly the\\nproduce of old or useless silver. I have turned the 11_s._ in the list\\ninto 12_s._, and the card looks all the better; a silver tea-ladle is\\nalso added, which will at least answer the purpose of making us\\nsometimes think of John Warren.\\n\\nI have laid Lady Sondes\\' case before Martha, who does not make the least\\nobjection to it, and is particularly pleased with the name of Montresor.\\nI do not agree with her there, but I like his rank very much, and always\\naffix the ideas of strong sense and highly elegant manners to a general.\\n\\nI must write to Charles next week. You may guess in what extravagant\\nterms of praise Earle Harwood speaks of him. He is looked up to by\\neverybody in all America.\\n\\nI shall not tell you anything more of Wm. Digweed\\'s china, as your\\nsilence on the subject makes you unworthy of it. Mrs. H. Digweed looks\\nforward with great satisfaction to our being her neighbors. I would\\nhave her enjoy the idea to the utmost, as I suspect there will not be\\nmuch in the reality. With equal pleasure we anticipate an intimacy with\\nher husband\\'s bailiff and his wife, who live close by us, and are said\\nto be remarkably good sort of people.\\n\\nYes, yes, we will have a pianoforte, as good a one as can be got for\\nthirty guineas, and I will practise country dances, that we may have\\nsome amusement for our nephews and nieces, when we have the pleasure of\\ntheir company.\\n\\nMartha sends her love to Henry, and tells him that he will soon have a\\nbill of Miss Chaplin\\'s, about 14_l._, to pay on her account; but the\\nbill shall not be sent in till his return to town. I hope he comes to\\nyou in good health, and in spirits as good as a first return to\\nGodmersham can allow. With his nephews he will force himself to be\\ncheerful, till he really is so. Send me some intelligence of Eliza; it\\nis a long while since I have heard of her.\\n\\nWe have had snow on the ground here almost a week; it is now going, but\\nSouthampton must boast no longer. We all send our love to Edward junior\\nand his brothers, and I hope Speculation is generally liked.\\n\\nFare you well.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\n                                                        J.

       "  'text': 'CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 10, 1809).\\n\\nI AM not surprised, my dear Cassandra, that you did not find my last\\nletter very full of matter, and I wish this may not have the same\\ndeficiency; but we are doing nothing ourselves to write about, and I am\\ntherefore quite dependent upon the communications of our friends, or my\\nown wits.\\n\\nThis post brought me two interesting letters, yours and one from\\nBookham, in answer to an inquiry of mine about your good godmother, of\\nwhom we had lately received a very alarming account from Paragon. Miss\\nArnold was the informant then, and she spoke of Mrs. E. L. having been\\nvery dangerously ill, and attended by a physician from Oxford.\\n\\nYour letter to Adlestrop may perhaps bring you information from the\\nspot, but in case it should not, I must tell you that she is better;\\nthough Dr. Bourne cannot yet call her out of danger; such was the case\\nlast Wednesday, and Mrs. Cooke\\'s having had no later account is a\\nfavorable sign. I am to hear again from the latter next week, but not\\nthis, if everything goes on well.\\n\\nHer disorder is an inflammation on the lungs, arising from a severe\\nchill taken in church last Sunday three weeks; her mind all pious\\ncomposure, as may be supposed. George Cooke was there when her illness\\nbegan; his brother has now taken his place. Her age and feebleness\\nconsidered, one\\'s fears cannot but preponderate, though her amendment\\nhas already surpassed the expectation of the physician at the beginning.\\nI am sorry to add that Becky is laid up with a complaint of the same\\nkind.\\n\\nI am very glad to have the time of your return at all fixed; we all\\nrejoice in it, and it will not be later than I had expected. I dare not\\nhope that Mary and Miss Curling may be detained at Portsmouth so long or\\nhalf so long; but it would be worth twopence to have it so.\\n\\nThe \"St. Albans\" perhaps may soon be off to help bring home what may\\nremain by this time of our poor army, whose state seems dreadfully\\ncritical. The \"Regency\" seems to have been heard of only here; my most\\npolitical correspondents make no mention of it. Unlucky that I should\\nhave wasted so much reflection on the subject.\\n\\nI can now answer your question to my mother more at large, and likewise\\nmore at small--with equal perspicuity and minuteness; for the very day\\nof our leaving Southampton is fixed; and if the knowledge is of no use\\nto Edward, I am sure it will give him pleasure. Easter Monday, April 3,\\nis the day; we are to sleep that night at Alton, and be with our friends\\nat Bookham the next, if they are then at home; there we remain till the\\nfollowing Monday, and on Tuesday, April 11, hope to be at Godmersham. If\\nthe Cookes are absent, we shall finish our journey on the 5th. These\\nplans depend of course upon the weather, but I hope there will be no\\nsettled cold to delay us materially.\\n\\nTo make you amends for being at Bookham, it is in contemplation to spend\\na few days at Baiton Lodge in our way out of Kent. The hint of such a\\nvisit is most affectionately welcomed by Mrs. Birch, in one of her odd\\npleasant letters lately, in which she speaks of us with the usual\\ndistinguished kindness, declaring that she shall not be at all satisfied\\nunless a very handsome present is made us immediately from one quarter.\\n\\nFanny\\'s not coming with you is no more than we expected; and as we have\\nnot the hope of a bed for her, and shall see her so soon afterwards at\\nGodmersham, we cannot wish it otherwise.\\n\\nWilliam will be quite recovered, I trust, by the time you receive this.\\nWhat a comfort his cross-stitch must have been! Pray tell him that I\\nshould like to see his work very much. I hope our answers this morning\\nhave given satisfaction; we had great pleasure in Uncle Deedes\\' packet;\\nand pray let Marianne know, in private, that I think she is quite right\\nto work a rug for Uncle John\\'s coffee urn, and that I am sure it must\\ngive great pleasure to herself now, and to him when he receives it.\\n\\nThe preference of Brag over Speculation does not greatly surprise me, I\\nbelieve, because I feel the same myself; but it mortifies me deeply,\\nbecause Speculation was under my patronage; and, after all, what is\\nthere so delightful in a pair royal of Braggers? It is but three nines\\nor three knaves, or a mixture of them. When one comes to reason upon it,\\nit cannot stand its ground against Speculation,--of which I hope Edward\\nis now convinced. Give my love to him if he is.\\n\\nThe letter from Paragon before mentioned was much like those which had\\npreceded it, as to the felicity of its writer. They found their house so\\ndirty and so damp that they were obliged to be a week at an inn. John\\nBinns had behaved most unhandsomely, and engaged himself elsewhere. They\\nhave a man, however, on the same footing, which my aunt does not like,\\nand she finds both him and the new maid-servant very, very inferior to\\nRobert and Martha. Whether they mean to have any other domestics does\\nnot appear, nor whether they are to have a carriage while they are in\\nBath.\\n\\nThe Holders are as usual, though I believe it is not very usual for them\\nto be happy, which they now are at a great rate, in Hooper\\'s marriage.\\nThe Irvines are not mentioned. The American lady improved as we went on;\\nbut still the same faults in part recurred.\\n\\nWe are now in Margiana, and like it very well indeed. We are just going\\nto set off for Northumberland to be shut up in Widdrington Tower, where\\nthere must be two or three sets of victims already immured under a very\\nfine villain.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--Your report of Eliza\\'s health gives me great pleasure, and\\nthe progress of the bank is a constant source of satisfaction. With such\\nincreasing profits, tell Henry that I hope he will not work poor\\nHigh-Diddle so hard as he used to do.\\n\\nHas your newspaper given a sad story of a Mrs. Middleton, wife of a\\nfarmer in Yorkshire, her sister, and servant, being almost frozen to\\ndeath in the late weather, her little child quite so? I hope the sister\\nis not our friend Miss Woodd, and I rather think her brother-in-law had\\nmoved into Lincolnshire, but their name and station accord too well.\\nMrs. M. and the maid are said to be tolerably recovered, but the sister\\nis likely to lose the use of her limbs.\\n\\nCharles\\'s rug will be finished to-day, and sent to-morrow to Frank, to\\nbe consigned by him to Mr. Turner\\'s care; and I am going to send Marmion\\nout with it,--very generous in me, I think.\\n\\nAs we have no letter from Adlestrop, we may suppose the good woman was\\nalive on Monday, but I cannot help expecting bad news from thence or\\nBookham in a few days. Do you continue quite well?\\n\\nHave you nothing to say of your little namesake? We join in love and\\nmany happy returns.\\n\\n                               Yours affectionately,       J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nThe Manydown ball was a smaller thing than I expected, but it seems to\\nhave made Anna very happy.

Yours has brought its usual measure of satisfaction\\nand amusement, and I beg your acceptance of all the thanks due on the\\noccasion. Your offer of cravats is very kind, and happens to be\\nparticularly adapted to my wants, but it was an odd thing to occur to\\nyou.\\n\\nYes, we have got another fall of snow, and are very dreadful; everything\\nseems to turn to snow this winter.\\n\\nI hope you have had no more illness among you, and that William will be\\nsoon as well as ever. His working a footstool for Chawton is a most\\nagreeable surprise to me, and I am sure his grandmamma will value it\\nvery much as a proof of his affection and industry, but we shall never\\nhave the heart to put our feet upon it. I believe I must work a muslin\\ncover in satin stitch to keep it from the dirt. I long to know what his\\ncolors are. I guess greens and purples.\\n\\nEdward and Henry have started a difficulty respecting our journey,\\nwhich, I must own with some confusion, had never been thought of by us;\\nbut if the former expected by it to prevent our travelling into Kent\\nentirely, he will be disappointed, for we have already determined to go\\nthe Croydon road on leaving Bookham and sleep at Dartford. Will not that\\ndo? There certainly does seem no convenient resting-place on the other\\nroad.\\n\\nAnna went to Clanville last Friday, and I have hopes of her new aunt\\'s\\nbeing really worth her knowing. Perhaps you may never have heard that\\nJames and Mary paid a morning visit there in form some weeks ago, and\\nMary, though by no means disposed to like her, was very much pleased\\nwith her indeed. Her praise, to be sure, proves nothing more than Mrs.\\nM.\\'s being civil and attentive to them, but her being so is in favor of\\nher having good sense. Mary writes of Anna as improved in person, but\\ngives her no other commendation. I am afraid her absence now may deprive\\nher of one pleasure, for that silly Mr. Hammond is actually to give his\\nball on Friday.\\n\\nWe had some reason to expect a visit from Earle Harwood and James this\\nweek, but they do not come. Miss Murden arrived last night at Mrs.\\nHookey\\'s, as a message and a basket announced to us. You will therefore\\nreturn to an enlarged and, of course, improved society here, especially\\nas the Miss Williamses are come back.\\n\\nWe were agreeably surprised the other day by a visit from your beauty\\nand mine, each in a new cloth mantle and bonnet; and I dare say you will\\nvalue yourself much on the modest propriety of Miss W.\\'s taste, hers\\nbeing purple and Miss Grace\\'s scarlet.\\n\\nI can easily suppose that your six weeks here will be fully occupied,\\nwere it only in lengthening the waists of your gowns. I have pretty well\\narranged my spring and summer plans of that kind, and mean to wear out\\nmy spotted muslin before I go. You will exclaim at this, but mine really\\nhas signs of feebleness, which with a little care may come to\\nsomething.\\n\\nMartha and Dr. Mant are as bad as ever; he runs after her in the street\\nto apologize for having spoken to a gentleman while she was near him the\\nday before. Poor Mrs. Mant can stand it no longer; she is retired to one\\nof her married daughters\\'.\\n\\nWhen William returns to Winchester Mary Jane is to go to Mrs. Nune\\'s for\\na month, and then to Steventon for a fortnight, and it seems likely that\\nshe and her aunt Martha may travel into Berkshire together.\\n\\nWe shall not have a month of Martha after your return, and that month\\nwill be a very interrupted and broken one, but we shall enjoy ourselves\\nthe more when we can get a quiet half-hour together.\\n\\nTo set against your new novel, of which nobody ever heard before, and\\nperhaps never may again, we have got \"Ida of Athens,\" by Miss Owenson,\\nwhich must be very clever, because it was written, as the authoress\\nsays, in three months. We have only read the preface yet, but her Irish\\ngirl does not make me expect much. If the warmth of her language could\\naffect the body, it might be worth reading in this weather.\\n\\nAdieu! I must leave off to stir the fire and call on Miss Murden.\\n\\n_Evening._--I have done them both, the first very often. We found our\\nfriend as comfortable as she can ever allow herself to be in cold\\nweather. There is a very neat parlor behind the shop for her to sit in,\\nnot very light indeed, being _à la_ Southampton, the middle of three\\ndeep, but very lively from the frequent sound of the pestle and mortar.\\n\\nWe afterwards called on the Miss Williamses, who lodge at Durantoy\\'s.\\nMiss Mary only was at home, and she is in very indifferent health. Dr.\\nHacket came in while we were there, and said that he never remembered\\nsuch a severe winter as this in Southampton before. It is bad, but we do\\nnot suffer as we did last year, because the wind has been more N.E. than\\nN.W.\\n\\nFor a day or two last week my mother was very poorly with a return of\\none of her old complaints, but it did not last long, and seems to have\\nleft nothing bad behind it. She began to talk of a serious illness, her\\ntwo last having been preceded by the same symptoms, but, thank heaven!\\nshe is now quite as well as one can expect her to be in weather which\\ndeprives her of exercise.\\n\\nMiss M. conveys to us a third volume of sermons, from Hamstall, just\\npublished, and which we are to like better than the two others; they are\\nprofessedly practical, and for the use of country congregations. I have\\njust received some verses in an unknown hand, and am desired to forward\\nthem to my nephew Edward at Godmersham.\\n\\n    Alas! poor Brag, thou boastful game!\\n    What now avails thine empty name?\\n    Where now thy more distinguished fame?\\n    My day is o\\'er, and thine the same,\\n    For thou, like me, art thrown aside\\n    At Godmersham, this Christmastide;\\n    And now across the table wide\\n    Each game save brag or spec. is tried.\\n    Such is the mild ejaculation\\n    Of tender-hearted speculation.\\n\\n_Wednesday._--I expected to have a letter from somebody to-day, but I\\nhave not. Twice every day I think of a letter from Portsmouth.\\n\\nMiss Murden has been sitting with us this morning. As yet she seems very\\nwell pleased with her situation. The worst part of her being in\\nSouthampton will be the necessity of one walking with her now and then,\\nfor she talks so loud that one is quite ashamed; but our dining hours\\nare luckily very different, which we shall take all reasonable advantage\\nof.\\n\\nThe Queen\\'s birthday moves the assembly to this night instead of last,\\nand as it is always fully attended, Martha and I expect an amusing show.\\nWe were in hopes of being independent of other companions by having the\\nattendance of Mr. Austen and Captain Harwood; but as they fail us, we\\nare obliged to look out for other help, and have fixed on the Wallops as\\nleast likely to be troublesome. I have called on them this morning and\\nfound them very willing, and I am sorry that you must wait a whole week\\nfor the particulars of the evening. I propose being asked to dance by\\nour acquaintance Mr. Smith, now _Captain_ Smith, who has lately\\nreappeared in Southampton, but I shall decline it. He saw Charles last\\nAugust.\\n\\nWhat an alarming bride Mrs. ---- must have been; such a parade is one of\\nthe most immodest pieces of modesty that one can imagine. To attract\\nnotice could have been her only wish. It augurs ill for her family; it\\nannounces not great sense, and therefore insures boundless influence.\\n\\nI hope Fanny\\'s visit is now taking place. You have said scarcely\\nanything of her lately, but I trust you are as good friends as ever.\\n\\nMartha sends her love, and hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you when\\nyou return to Southampton. You are to understand this message as being\\nmerely for the sake of a message to oblige me.\\n\\n                                    Yours affectionately,\\n                                                      J.

       "  'text': 'CASTLE SQUARE, Tuesday (January 24).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I will give you the indulgence of a letter on\\nThursday this week, instead of Friday, but I do not require you to write\\nagain before Sunday, provided I may believe you and your finger going on\\nquite well. Take care of your precious self; do not work too hard.\\nRemember that Aunt Cassandras are quite as scarce as Miss Beverleys.[11]\\n\\nI had the happiness yesterday of a letter from Charles, but I shall say\\nas little about it as possible, because I know that excruciating Henry\\nwill have had a letter likewise, to make all my intelligence valueless.\\nIt was written at Bermuda on the 7th and 10th of December. All well, and\\nFanny still only in expectation of being otherwise. He had taken a small\\nprize in his late cruise,--a French schooner, laden with sugar; but bad\\nweather parted them, and she had not yet been heard of. His cruise ended\\nDecember 1st. My September letter was the latest he had received.\\n\\nThis day three weeks you are to be in London, and I wish you better\\nweather; not but that you may have worse, for we have now nothing but\\nceaseless snow or rain and insufferable dirt to complain of; no\\ntempestuous winds nor severity of cold. Since I wrote last we have had\\nsomething of each, but it is not genteel to rip up old grievances.\\n\\nYou used me scandalously by not mentioning Edward Cooper\\'s sermons. I\\ntell you everything, and it is unknown the mysteries you conceal from\\nme; and, to add to the rest, you persevere in giving a final \"e\" to\\n\"invalid,\" thereby putting it out of one\\'s power to suppose Mrs. E.\\nLeigh, even for a moment, a veteran soldier. She, good woman, is, I\\nhope, destined for some further placid enjoyment of her own excellence\\nin this world, for her recovery advances exceedingly well.\\n\\nI had this pleasant news in a letter from Bookham last Thursday; but as\\nthe letter was from Mary instead of her mother, you will guess her\\naccount was not equally good from home. Mrs. Cooke had been confined to\\nher bed some days by illness, but was then better, and Mary wrote in\\nconfidence of her continuing to mend. I have desired to hear again soon.\\n\\nYou rejoice me by what you say of Fanny.[12] I hope she will not turn\\ngood-for-nothing this ever so long. We thought of and talked of her\\nyesterday with sincere affection, and wished her a long enjoyment of all\\nthe happiness to which she seems born. While she gives happiness to\\nthose about her she is pretty sure of her own share.\\n\\nI am gratified by her having pleasure in what I write, but I wish the\\nknowledge of my being exposed to her discerning criticism may not hurt\\nmy style, by inducing too great a solicitude. I begin already to weigh\\nmy words and sentences more than I did, and am looking about for a\\nsentiment, an illustration, or a metaphor in every corner of the room.\\nCould my ideas flow as fast as the rain in the store-closet, it would be\\ncharming.\\n\\nWe have been in two or three dreadful states within the last week, from\\nthe melting of the snow, etc., and the contest between us and the closet\\nhas now ended in our defeat. I have been obliged to move almost\\neverything out of it, and leave it to splash itself as it likes.\\n\\nYou have by no means raised my curiosity after Caleb. My disinclination\\nfor it before was affected, but now it is real. I do not like the\\nevangelicals. Of course I shall be delighted when I read it, like other\\npeople; but till I do I dislike it.\\n\\nI am sorry my verses did not bring any return from Edward. I was in\\nhopes they might, but I suppose he does not rate them high enough. It\\nmight be partiality, but they seemed to me purely classical,--just like\\nHomer and Virgil, Ovid and Propria que Maribus.\\n\\nI had a nice brotherly letter from Frank the other day, which, after an\\ninterval of nearly three weeks, was very welcome. No orders were come on\\nFriday, and none were come yesterday, or we should have heard to-day. I\\nhad supposed Miss C. would share her cousin\\'s room here, but a message\\nin this letter proves the contrary. I will make the garret as\\ncomfortable as I can, but the possibilities of that apartment are not\\ngreat.\\n\\nMy mother has been talking to Eliza about our future home, and she,\\nmaking no difficulty at all of the sweetheart, is perfectly disposed to\\ncontinue with us, but till she has written home for mother\\'s approbation\\ncannot quite decide. Mother does not like to have her so far off. At\\nChawton she will be nine or ten miles nearer, which I hope will have its\\ndue influence.\\n\\nAs for Sally, she means to play John Binns with us, in her anxiety to\\nbelong to our household again. Hitherto she appears a very good servant.\\n\\nYou depend upon finding all your plants dead, I hope. They look very\\nill, I understand.\\n\\nYour silence on the subject of our ball makes me suppose your curiosity\\ntoo great for words. We were very well entertained, and could have\\nstayed longer but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home,\\nand I did not like to keep them waiting in the cold. The room was\\ntolerably full, and the ball opened by Miss Glyn. The Miss Lances had\\npartners, Captain Dauvergne\\'s friend appeared in regimentals, Caroline\\nMaitland had an officer to flirt with, and Mr. John Harrison was deputed\\nby Captain Smith, being himself absent, to ask me to dance. Everything\\nwent well, you see, especially after we had tucked Mrs. Lance\\'s\\nneckerchief in behind and fastened it with a pin.\\n\\nWe had a very full and agreeable account of Mr. Hammond\\'s ball from Anna\\nlast night; the same fluent pen has sent similar information, I know,\\ninto Kent. She seems to have been as happy as one could wish her, and\\nthe complacency of her mamma in doing the honors of the evening must\\nhave made her pleasure almost as great. The grandeur of the meeting was\\nbeyond my hopes. I should like to have seen Anna\\'s looks and\\nperformance, but that sad cropped head must have injured the former.\\n\\nMartha pleases herself with believing that if I had kept her counsel you\\nwould never have heard of Dr. M.\\'s late behavior, as if the very slight\\nmanner in which I mentioned it could have been all on which you found\\nyour judgment. I do not endeavor to undeceive her, because I wish her\\nhappy, at all events, and know how highly she prizes happiness of any\\nkind. She is, moreover, so full of kindness for us both, and sends you\\nin particular so many good wishes about your finger, that I am willing\\nto overlook a venial fault, and as Dr. M. is a clergyman, their\\nattachment, however immoral, has a decorous air. Adieu, sweet You. This\\nis grievous news from Spain. It is well that Dr. Moore was spared the\\nknowledge of such a son\\'s death.\\n\\n                                Yours affectionately,      J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nAnna\\'s hand gets better and better; it begins to be too good for any\\nconsequence.\\n\\nWe send best love to dear little Lizzy and Marianne in particular.\\n\\nThe Portsmouth paper gave a melancholy history of a poor mad woman,\\nescaped from confinement, who said her husband and daughter, of the name\\nof Payne, lived at Ashford, in Kent. Do you own them?\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[11] \"Cecilia\" Beverley, the heroine of Miss Burney\\'s novel.\\n\\n[12] Fanny Austen, afterward Lady Edward Knatchbull.'},\n",

I wish the poor little girls\\nhad better weather for their journey; they must amuse themselves with\\nwatching the raindrops down the windows. Sackree, I suppose, feels quite\\nbroken-hearted. I cannot have done with the weather without observing\\nhow delightfully mild it is; I am sure Fanny must enjoy it with us.\\nYesterday was a very blowing day; we got to church, however, which we\\nhad not been able to do for two Sundays before.\\n\\nI am not at all ashamed about the name of the novel, having been guilty\\nof no insult toward your handwriting; the diphthong I always saw, but\\nknowing how fond you were of adding a vowel wherever you could, I\\nattributed it to that alone, and the knowledge of the truth does the\\nbook no service; the only merit it could have was in the name of Caleb,\\nwhich has an honest, unpretending sound, but in Coelebs there is\\npedantry and affectation. Is it written only to classical scholars?\\n\\nI shall now try to say only what is necessary, I am weary of meandering;\\nso expect a vast deal of small matter, concisely told, in the next two\\npages.\\n\\nMrs. Cooke has been very dangerously ill, but is now, I hope, safe. I\\nhad a letter last week from George, Mary being too busy to write, and at\\nthat time the disorder was called of the typhus kind, and their alarm\\nconsiderable, but yesterday brought me a much better account from Mary,\\nthe origin of the complaint being now ascertained to be bilious, and the\\nstrong medicines requisite promising to be effectual. Mrs. E. L. is so\\nmuch recovered as to get into the dressing-room every day.\\n\\nA letter from Hamstall gives us the history of Sir Tho. Williams\\'s\\nreturn. The Admiral, whoever he might he, took a fancy to the \"Neptune,\"\\nand having only a worn-out 74 to offer in lieu of it, Sir Tho. declined\\nsuch a command, and is come home passenger. Lucky man! to have so fair\\nan opportunity of escape. I hope his wife allows herself to be happy on\\nthe occasion, and does not give all her thoughts to being nervous.\\n\\nA great event happens this week at Hamstall in young Edward\\'s removal to\\nschool. He is going to Rugby, and is very happy in the idea of it; I\\nwish his happiness may last, but it will be a great change to become a\\nraw school-boy from being a pompous sermon-writer and a domineering\\nbrother. It will do him good, I dare say.\\n\\nCaroline has had a great escape from being burnt to death lately. As her\\nhusband gives the account, we must believe it true. Miss Murden is\\ngone,--called away by the critical state of Mrs. Pottinger who has had\\nanother severe stroke, and is without sense or speech. Miss Murden\\nwishes to return to Southampton if circumstances suit, but it must be\\nvery doubtful.\\n\\nWe have been obliged to turn away Cholles, he grew so very drunken and\\nnegligent, and we have a man in his place called Thomas.\\n\\nMartha desires me to communicate something concerning herself which she\\nknows will give you pleasure, as affording her very particular\\nsatisfaction,--it is that she is to be in town this spring with Mrs.\\nDundas. I need not dilate on the subject. You understand enough of the\\nwhys and wherefores to enter into her feelings, and to be conscious that\\nof all possible arrangements it is the one most acceptable to her. She\\ngoes to Barton on leaving us, and the family remove to town in April.\\n\\nWhat you tell me of Miss Sharpe is quite new, and surprises me a little;\\nI feel, however, as you do. She is born, poor thing! to struggle with\\nevil, and her continuing with Miss B. is, I hope, a proof that matters\\nare not always so very bad between them as her letters sometimes\\nrepresent.\\n\\nJenny\\'s marriage I had heard of, and supposed you would do so too from\\nSteventon, as I knew you were corresponding with Mary at the time. I\\nhope she will not sully the respectable name she now bears.\\n\\nYour plan for Miss Curling is uncommonly considerate and friendly, and\\nsuch as she must surely jump at. Edward\\'s going round by Steventon, as I\\nunderstand he promises to do, can be no reasonable objection; Mrs. J.\\nAusten\\'s hospitality is just of the kind to enjoy such a visitor.\\n\\nWe were very glad to know Aunt Fanny was in the country when we read of\\nthe fire. Pray give my best compliments to the Mrs. Finches, if they are\\nat Gm. I am sorry to find that Sir J. Moore has a mother living, but\\nthough a very heroic son he might not be a very necessary one to her\\nhappiness. Deacon Morrell may be more to Mrs. Morrell.\\n\\nI wish Sir John had united something of the Christian with the hero in\\nhis death. Thank heaven! we have had no one to care for particularly\\namong the troops,--no one, in fact, nearer to us than Sir John himself.\\nCol. Maitland is safe and well; his mother and sisters were of course\\nanxious about him, but there is no entering much into the solicitudes of\\nthat family.\\n\\nMy mother is well, and gets out when she can with the same enjoyment,\\nand apparently the same strength, as hitherto. She hopes you will not\\nomit begging Mrs. Seward to get the garden cropped for us, supposing she\\nleaves the house too early to make the garden any object to herself. We\\nare very desirous of receiving your account of the house, for your\\nobservations will have a motive which can leave nothing to conjecture\\nand suffer nothing from want of memory. For one\\'s own dear self, one\\nascertains and remembers everything.\\n\\nLady Sondes is an impudent woman to come back into her old neighborhood\\nagain; I suppose she pretends never to have married before, and wonders\\nhow her father and mother came to have her christened Lady Sondes.\\n\\nThe store-closet, I hope, will never do so again, for much of the evil\\nis proved to have proceeded from the gutter being choked up, and we have\\nhad it cleared. We had reason to rejoice in the child\\'s absence at the\\ntime of the thaw, for the nursery was not habitable. We hear of similar\\ndisasters from almost everybody.\\n\\nNo news from Portsmouth.

       "  'text': 'SLOANE ST., Thursday (April 18, 1811).\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--I have so many little matters to tell you of, that I\\ncannot wait any longer before I begin to put them down. I spent Tuesday\\nin Bentinck Street. The Cookes called here and took me back, and it was\\nquite a Cooke day, for the Miss Rolles paid a visit while I was there,\\nand Sam Arnold dropped in to tea.\\n\\nThe badness of the weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine,--that\\nof calling on Miss Beckford again; but from the middle of the day it\\nrained incessantly. Mary and I, after disposing of her father and\\nmother, went to the Liverpool Museum and the British Gallery, and I had\\nsome amusement at each, though my preference for men and women always\\ninclines me to attend more to the company than the sight.\\n\\nMrs. Cooke regrets very much that she did not see you when you called;\\nit was owing to a blunder among the servants, for she did not know of\\nour visit till we were gone. She seems tolerably well, but the nervous\\npart of her complaint, I fear, increases, and makes her more and more\\nunwilling to part with Mary.\\n\\nI have proposed to the latter that she should go to Chawton with me, on\\nthe supposition of my travelling the Guildford road, and she, I do\\nbelieve, would be glad to do it, but perhaps it may be impossible;\\nunless a brother can be at home at that time, it certainly must. George\\ncomes to them to-day.\\n\\nI did not see Theo. till late on Tuesday; he was gone to Ilford, but he\\ncame back in time to show his usual nothing-meaning, harmless, heartless\\ncivility. Henry, who had been confined the whole day to the bank, took\\nme in his way home, and, after putting life and wit into the party for a\\nquarter of an hour, put himself and his sister into a hackney coach.\\n\\nI bless my stars that I have done with Tuesday. But, alas! Wednesday was\\nlikewise a day of great doings, for Manon and I took our walk to Grafton\\nHouse, and I have a good deal to say on that subject.\\n\\nI am sorry to tell you that I am getting very extravagant, and spending\\nall my money, and, what is worse for you, I have been spending yours\\ntoo; for in a linendraper\\'s shop to which I went for checked muslin, and\\nfor which I was obliged to give seven shillings a yard, I was tempted by\\na pretty-colored muslin, and bought ten yards of it on the chance of\\nyour liking it; but at the same time, if it should not suit you, you\\nmust not think yourself at all obliged to take it; it is only 3_s._\\n6_d._ per yard, and I should not in the least mind keeping the whole. In\\ntexture it is just what we prefer, but its resemblance to green crewels,\\nI must own, is not great, for the pattern is a small red spot. And now I\\nbelieve I have done all my commissions except Wedgwood.\\n\\nI liked my walk very much; it was shorter than I had expected, and the\\nweather was delightful. We set off immediately after breakfast, and must\\nhave reached Grafton House by half-past eleven; but when we entered the\\nshop the whole counter was thronged, and we waited full half an hour\\nbefore we could be attended to. When we were served, however, I was\\nvery well satisfied with my purchases,--my bugle trimming at 2_s._ 4_d._\\nand three pair silk stockings for a little less than 12_s._ a pair.\\n\\nIn my way back who should I meet but Mr. Moore, just come from\\nBeckenham. I believe he would have passed me if I had not made him stop,\\nbut we were delighted to meet. I soon found, however, that he had\\nnothing new to tell me, and then I let him go.\\n\\nMiss Burton has made me a very pretty little bonnet, and now nothing can\\nsatisfy me but I must have a straw hat, of the riding-hat shape, like\\nMrs. Tilson\\'s; and a young woman in this neighborhood is actually making\\nme one. I am really very shocking, but it will not be dear at a guinea.\\nOur pelisses are 17_s._ each; she charges only 8_s._ for the making, but\\nthe buttons seem expensive,--are expensive, I might have said, for the\\nfact is plain enough.\\n\\nWe drank tea again yesterday with the Tilsons, and met the Smiths. I\\nfind all these little parties very pleasant. I like Mrs. S.; Miss Beaty\\nis good-humor itself, and does not seem much besides. We spend to-morrow\\nevening with them, and are to meet the Coln. and Mrs. Cantelo Smith you\\nhave been used to hear of, and, if she is in good humor, are likely to\\nhave excellent singing.\\n\\nTo-night I might have been at the play; Henry had kindly planned our\\ngoing together to the Lyceum, but I have a cold which I should not like\\nto make worse before Saturday, so I stay within all this day.\\n\\nEliza is walking out by herself. She has plenty of business on her hands\\njust now, for the day of the party is settled, and drawing near. Above\\neighty people are invited for next Tuesday evening, and there is to be\\nsome very good music,--five professionals, three of them glee singers,\\nbesides amateurs. Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings is a\\nCapital on the harp, from which I expect great pleasure. The foundation\\nof the party was a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter, but the\\nlatter leaves town the day before. I am sorry, as I wished her prejudice\\nto be done away, but should have been more sorry if there had been no\\ninvitation.\\n\\nI am a wretch, to be so occupied with all these things as to seem to\\nhave no thoughts to give to people and circumstances which really supply\\na far more lasting interest,--the society in which you are; but I do\\nthink of you all, I assure you, and want to know all about everybody,\\nand especially about your visit to the W. Friars; _mais le moyen_ not to\\nbe occupied by one\\'s own concerns?\\n\\n_Saturday._--Frank is superseded in the \"Caledonia.\" Henry brought us\\nthis news yesterday from Mr. Daysh, and he heard at the same time that\\nCharles may be in England in the course of a month. Sir Edward Pollen\\nsucceeds Lord Gambier in his command, and some captain of his succeeds\\nFrank; and I believe the order is already gone out. Henry means to\\ninquire further to-day. He wrote to Mary on the occasion. This is\\nsomething to think of. Henry is convinced that he will have the offer of\\nsomething else, but does not think it will be at all incumbent on him to\\naccept it; and then follows, what will he do? and where will he live?\\n\\nI hope to hear from you to-day. How are you as to health, strength,\\nlooks, etc.? I had a very comfortable account from Chawton yesterday.\\n\\nIf the weather permits, Eliza and I walk into London this morning. She\\nis in want of chimney lights for Tuesday, and I of an ounce of\\ndarning-cotton. She has resolved not to venture to the play to-night.\\nThe D\\'Entraigues and Comte Julien cannot come to the party, which was at\\nfirst a grief, but she has since supplied herself so well with\\nperformers that it is of no consequence; their not coming has produced\\nour going to them to-morrow evening, which I like the idea of. It will\\nbe amusing to see the ways of a French circle.\\n\\nI wrote to Mrs. Hill a few days ago, and have received a most kind and\\nsatisfactory answer. Any time the first week in May exactly suits her,\\nand therefore I consider my going as tolerably fixed. I shall leave\\nSloane Street on the 1st or 2d, and be ready for James on the 9th, and,\\nif his plan alters, I can take care of myself. I have explained my views\\nhere, and everything is smooth and pleasant; and Eliza talks kindly of\\nconveying me to Streatham.\\n\\nWe met the Tilsons yesterday evening, but the singing Smiths sent an\\nexcuse, which put our Mrs. Smith out of humor.\\n\\nWe are come back, after a good dose of walking and coaching, and I have\\nthe pleasure of your letter. I wish I had James\\'s verses, but they were\\nleft at Chawton. When I return thither, if Mrs. K. will give me leave, I\\nwill send them to her.\\n\\nOur first object to-day was Henrietta St., to consult with Henry in\\nconsequence of a very unlucky change of the play for this very\\nnight,--\"Hamlet\" instead of \"King John,\"--and we are to go on Monday to\\n\"Macbeth\" instead; but it is a disappointment to us both.\\n\\nLove to all.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\n                                                    JANE.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, EDWARD AUSTEN\\'S, Esq.,\\n    Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.'},\n",

It has been hot here, as you may suppose, since it was so\\nhot with you, but I have not suffered from it at all, nor felt it in\\nsuch a degree as to make me imagine it would be anything in the country.\\nEverybody has talked of the heat, but I set it all down to London.\\n\\nI give you joy of our new nephew, and hope if he ever comes to be hanged\\nit will not be till we are too old to care about it. It is a great\\ncomfort to have it so safely and speedily over. The Miss Curlings must\\nbe hard worked in writing so many letters, but the novelty of it may\\nrecommend it to them; mine was from Miss Eliza, and she says that my\\nbrother may arrive to-day.\\n\\nNo, indeed, I am never too busy to think of S. and S.[13] I can no more\\nforget it than a mother can forget her sucking child; and I am much\\nobliged to you for your inquiries. I have had two sheets to correct, but\\nthe last only brings us to Willoughby\\'s first appearance. Mrs. K.\\nregrets in the most flattering manner that she must wait till May, but I\\nhave scarcely a hope of its being out in June. Henry does not neglect\\nit; he has hurried the printer, and says he will see him again to-day.\\nIt will not stand still during his absence, it will be sent to Eliza.\\n\\nThe Incomes remain as they were, but I will get them altered if I can. I\\nam very much gratified by Mrs. K.\\'s interest in it; and whatever may be\\nthe event of it as to my credit with her, sincerely wish her curiosity\\ncould be satisfied sooner than is now probable. I think she will like my\\nElinor, but cannot build on anything else.\\n\\nOur party went off extremely well. There were many solicitudes, alarms,\\nand vexations beforehand, of course, but at last everything was quite\\nright. The rooms were dressed up with flowers, etc., and looked very\\npretty. A glass for the mantelpiece was lent by the man who is making\\ntheir own. Mr. Egerton and Mr. Walter came at half-past five, and the\\nfestivities began with a pair of very fine soles.\\n\\nYes, Mr. Walter--for he postponed his leaving London on purpose--which\\ndid not give much pleasure at the time, any more than the circumstance\\nfrom which it rose,--his calling on Sunday and being asked by Henry to\\ntake the family dinner on that day, which he did; but it is all smoothed\\nover now, and she likes him very well.\\n\\nAt half-past seven arrived the musicians in two hackney coaches, and by\\neight the lordly company began to appear. Among the earliest were George\\nand Mary Cooke, and I spent the greatest part of the evening very\\npleasantly with them. The drawing-room being soon hotter than we liked,\\nwe placed ourselves in the connecting passage, which was comparatively\\ncool, and gave us all the advantage of the music at a pleasant distance,\\nas well as that of the first view of every new-comer.\\n\\nI was quite surrounded by acquaintance, especially gentlemen; and what\\nwith Mr. Hampson, Mr. Seymour, Mr. W. Knatchbull, Mr. Guillemarde, Mr.\\nCure, a Captain Simpson, brother to _the_ Captain Simpson, besides Mr.\\nWalter and Mr. Egerton, in addition to the Cookes, and Miss Beckford,\\nand Miss Middleton, I had quite as much upon my hands as I could do.\\n\\nPoor Miss B. has been suffering again from her old complaint, and looks\\nthinner than ever. She certainly goes to Cheltenham the beginning of\\nJune. We were all delight and cordiality, of course. Miss M. seems very\\nhappy, but has not beauty enough to figure in London.\\n\\nIncluding everybody we were sixty-six,--which was considerably more than\\nEliza had expected, and quite enough to fill the back drawing-room and\\nleave a few to be scattered about in the other and in the passage.\\n\\nThe music was extremely good. It opened (tell Fanny) with \"Poike de Parp\\npirs praise pof Prapela;\" and of the other glees I remember, \"In peace\\nlove tunes,\" \"Rosabelle,\" \"The Red Cross Knight,\" and \"Poor Insect.\"\\nBetween the songs were lessons on the harp, or harp and pianoforte\\ntogether; and the harp-player was Wiepart, whose name seems famous,\\nthough new to me. There was one female singer, a short Miss Davis, all\\nin blue, bringing up for the public line, whose voice was said to be\\nvery fine indeed; and all the performers gave great satisfaction by\\ndoing what they were paid for, and giving themselves no airs. No amateur\\ncould be persuaded to do anything.\\n\\nThe house was not clear till after twelve. If you wish to hear more of\\nit, you must put your questions, but I seem rather to have exhausted\\nthan spared the subject.\\n\\nThis said Captain Simpson told us, on the authority of some other\\nCaptain just arrived from Halifax, that Charles was bringing the\\n\"Cleopatra\" home, and that she was probably by this time in the\\nChannel; but as Captain S. was certainly in liquor, we must not quite\\ndepend on it. It must give one a sort of expectation, however, and will\\nprevent my writing to him any more. I would rather he should not reach\\nEngland till I am at home, and the Steventon party gone.\\n\\nMy mother and Martha both write with great satisfaction of Anna\\'s\\nbehavior. She is quite an Anna with variations, but she cannot have\\nreached her last, for that is always the most flourishing and showy; she\\nis at about her third or fourth, which are generally simple and pretty.\\n\\nYour lilacs are in leaf, ours are in bloom. The horse-chestnuts are\\nquite out, and the elms almost. I had a pleasant walk in Kensington\\nGardens on Sunday with Henry, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Tilson; everything was\\nfresh and beautiful.\\n\\nWe did go to the play, after all, on Saturday. We went to the Lyceum,\\nand saw the \"Hypocrite,\" an old play taken from Molière\\'s \"Tartuffe,\"\\nand were well entertained. Dowton and Mathews were the good actors; Mrs.\\nEdwin was the heroine, and her performance is just what it used to be. I\\nhave no chance of seeing Mrs. Siddons; she did act on Monday, but as\\nHenry was told by the box-keeper that he did not think she would, the\\nplans, and all thought of it, were given up. I should particularly have\\nliked seeing her in \"Constance,\" and could swear at her with little\\neffort for disappointing me.\\n\\nHenry has been to the Water-Color Exhibition, which opened on Monday,\\nand is to meet us there again some morning. If Eliza cannot go (and she\\nhas a cold at present), Miss Beaty will be invited to be my companion.\\nHenry leaves town on Sunday afternoon, but he means to write soon\\nhimself to Edward, and will tell his own plans.\\n\\nThe tea is this moment setting out.\\n\\nDo not have your colored muslin unless you really want it, because I am\\nafraid I could not send it to the coach without giving trouble here.\\n\\nEliza caught her cold on Sunday in our way to the D\\'Entraigues. The\\nhorses actually gibbed on this side of Hyde Park Gate: a load of fresh\\ngravel made it a formidable hill to them, and they refused the collar; I\\nbelieve there was a sore shoulder to irritate. Eliza was frightened, and\\nwe got out, and were detained in the evening air several minutes. The\\ncold is in her chest, but she takes care of herself, and I hope it may\\nnot last long.\\n\\nThis engagement prevented Mr. Walter\\'s staying late,--he had his coffee\\nand went away. Eliza enjoyed her evening very much, and means to\\ncultivate the acquaintance; and I see nothing to dislike in them but\\ntheir taking quantities of snuff. Monsieur, the old Count, is a very\\nfine-looking man, with quiet manners, good enough for an Englishman,\\nand, I believe, is a man of great information and taste. He has some\\nfine paintings, which delighted Henry as much as the son\\'s music\\ngratified Eliza; and among them a miniature of Philip V. of Spain, Louis\\nXIV.\\'s grandson, which exactly suited my capacity. Count Julien\\'s\\nperformance is very wonderful.\\n\\nWe met only Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, and we are just now engaged to\\nspend next Sunday evening at Mrs. L.\\'s, and to meet the D\\'Entraigues,\\nbut M. le Comte must do without Henry. If he would but speak English, I\\nwould take to him.\\n\\nHave you ever mentioned the leaving off tea to Mrs. K.? Eliza has just\\nspoken of it again. The benefit she has found from it in sleeping has\\nbeen very great.\\n\\nI shall write soon to Catherine to fix my day, which will be Thursday.\\nWe have no engagement but for Sunday. Eliza\\'s cold makes quiet\\nadvisable. Her party is mentioned in this morning\\'s paper. I am sorry to\\nhear of poor Fanny\\'s state. From that quarter, I suppose, is to be the\\nalloy of her happiness. I will have no more to say.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\n                                                     J.

The\\ndelay, however, is not great, and everything seems generally arranging\\nitself for your return very comfortably.\\n\\nI found Henry perfectly predisposed to bring you to London if agreeable\\nto yourself; he has not fixed his day for going into Kent, but he must\\nbe back again before ye 20th. You may therefore think with something\\nlike certainty of the close of your Godmersham visit, and will have, I\\nsuppose, about a week for Sloane Street. He travels in his gig, and\\nshould the weather be tolerable I think you must have a delightful\\njourney.\\n\\nI have given up all idea of Miss Sharpe\\'s travelling with you and\\nMartha, for though you are both all compliance with my scheme, yet as\\nyou knock off a week from the end of her visit, and Martha rather more\\nfrom the beginning, the thing is out of the question.\\n\\nI have written to her to say that after the middle of July we shall be\\nhappy to receive her, and I have added a welcome if she could make her\\nway hither directly, but I do not expect that she will. I have also sent\\nour invitation to Cowes.\\n\\nWe are very sorry for the disappointment you have all had in Lady B.\\'s\\nillness; but a division of the proposed party is with you by this time,\\nand I hope may have brought you a better account of the rest.\\n\\nGive my love and thanks to Harriot, who has written me charming things\\nof your looks, and diverted me very much by poor Mrs. C.

Mr. Tilson took a sketch of the Great House before dinner, and\\nafter dinner we all three walked to Chawton Park,[14] meaning to go into\\nit, but it was too dirty, and we were obliged to keep on the outside.\\nMr. Tilson admired the trees very much, but grieved that they should not\\nbe turned into money.\\n\\nMy mother\\'s cold is better, and I believe she only wants dry weather to\\nbe very well. It was a great distress to her that Anna should be absent\\nduring her uncle\\'s visit, a distress which I could not share. She does\\nnot return from Faringdon till this evening, and I doubt not has had\\nplenty of the miscellaneous, unsettled sort of happiness which seems to\\nsuit her best. We hear from Miss Benn, who was on the Common with the\\nProwtings, that she was very much admired by the gentlemen in general.\\n\\nI like your new bonnets exceedingly; yours is a shape which always looks\\nwell, and I think Fanny\\'s particularly becoming to her.\\n\\nOn Monday I had the pleasure of receiving, unpacking, and approving our\\nWedgwood ware.

There are\\nmore gooseberries and fewer currants than I thought at first.

Upon Mrs. ----\\'s mentioning that she had sent the rejected\\naddresses to Mrs. H., I began talking to her a little about them, and\\nexpressed my hope of their having amused her. Her answer was, \"Oh dear,\\nyes, very much, very droll indeed, the opening of the house, and the\\nstriking up of the fiddles!\" What she meant, poor woman, who shall say?\\nI sought no farther. As soon as a whist-party was formed, and a round\\ntable threatened, I made my mother an excuse and came away, leaving just\\nas many for their round table as there were at Mrs. Grant\\'s.[16] I wish\\nthey might be as agreeable a set. My mother is very well, and finds\\ngreat amusement in glove-knitting, and at present wants no other work.\\nWe quite run over with books. She has got Sir John Carr\\'s \"Travels in\\nSpain,\" and I am reading a Society octavo, an \"Essay on the Military\\nPolice and Institutions of the British Empire,\" by Capt. Pasley of the\\nEngineers,--a book which I protested against at first, but which upon\\ntrial I find delightfully written and highly entertaining. I am as much\\nin love with the author as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even\\nthe two Mr. Smiths of the city. The first soldier I ever sighed for; but\\nhe does write with extraordinary force and spirit. Yesterday, moreover,\\nbrought us \"Mrs. Grant\\'s Letters,\" with Mr. White\\'s compliments; but I\\nhave disposed of them, compliments and all, to Miss P., and amongst so\\nmany readers or retainers of books as we have in Chawton, I dare say\\nthere will be no difficulty in getting rid of them for another\\nfortnight, if necessary. I have disposed of Mrs. Grant for the second\\nfortnight to Mrs. ----. It can make no difference to her which of the\\ntwenty-six fortnights in the year the three vols. lie on her table. I\\nhave been applied to for information as to the oath taken in former\\ntimes of Bell, Book, and Candle, but have none to give. Perhaps you may\\nbe able to learn something of its origin where you now are.

       "  'text': 'SLOANE STREET, Thursday, May 20.\\n\\nMY DEAR CASSANDRA,--Before I say anything else, I claim a paper full of\\nhalfpence on the drawing-room mantelpiece; I put them there myself, and\\nforgot to bring them with me. I cannot say that I have yet been in any\\ndistress for money, but I choose to have my due, as well as the Devil.\\nHow lucky we were in our weather yesterday! This wet morning makes one\\nmore sensible of it. We had no rain of any consequence. The head of the\\ncurricle was put half up three or four times, but our share of the\\nshowers was very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy all round us,\\nwhen we were on the Hog\\'s-back, and I fancied it might then be raining\\nso hard at Chawton as to make you feel for us much more than we\\ndeserved. Three hours and a quarter took us to Guildford, where we\\nstayed barely two hours, and had only just time enough for all we had\\nto do there; that is, eating a long and comfortable breakfast, watching\\nthe carriages, paying Mr. Harrington, and taking a little stroll\\nafterwards. From some views which that stroll gave us, I think most\\nhighly of the situation of Guildford. We wanted all our brothers and\\nsisters to be standing with us in the bowling-green, and looking towards\\nHorsham. I was very lucky in my gloves,--got them at the first shop I\\nwent to, though I went into it rather because it was near than because\\nit looked at all like a glove-shop, and gave only four shillings for\\nthem; after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting\\nthat they cannot be good for anything, and their worth certainly remains\\nto be proved; but I think they look very well. We left Guildford at\\ntwenty minutes before twelve (I hope somebody cares for these minutiæ),\\nand were at Esher in about two hours more. I was very much pleased with\\nthe country in general. Between Guildford and Ripley I thought it\\nparticularly pretty, also about Painshill; and from a Mr. Spicer\\'s\\ngrounds at Esher, which we walked into before dinner, the views were\\nbeautiful. I cannot say what we did _not_ see, but I should think there\\ncould not be a wood, or a meadow, or palace, or remarkable spot in\\nEngland that was not spread out before us on one side or other.\\nClaremont is going to be sold: a Mr. Ellis has it now. It is a house\\nthat seems never to have prospered. After dinner we walked forward to be\\novertaken at the coachman\\'s time, and before he did overtake us we were\\nvery near Kingston. I fancy it was about half-past six when we reached\\nthis house,--a twelve hours\\' business, and the horses did not appear\\nmore than reasonably tired. I was very tired too, and glad to get to bed\\nearly, but am quite well to-day. I am very snug in the front\\ndrawing-room all to myself, and would not say \"thank you\" for any\\ncompany but you. The quietness of it does me good. I have contrived to\\npay my two visits, though the weather made me a great while about it,\\nand left me only a few minutes to sit with Charlotte Craven.[17] She\\nlooks very well, and her hair is done up with an elegance to do credit\\nto any education. Her manners are as unaffected and pleasing as ever.\\nShe had heard from her mother to-day. Mrs. Craven spends another\\nfortnight at Chilton. I saw nobody but Charlotte, which pleased me best.\\nI was shown upstairs into a drawing-room, where she came to me; and the\\nappearance of the room, so totally unschoollike, amused me very much: it\\nwas full of modern elegances.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affec^{tly},\\n                                                      J.

       "  'text': 'SLOANE STREET, Monday (May 24).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I am very much obliged to you for writing to me.\\nYou must have hated it after a worrying morning. Your letter came just\\nin time to save my going to Remnant\\'s, and fit me for Christian\\'s, where\\nI bought Fanny\\'s dimity.\\n\\nI went the day before (Friday) to Layton\\'s as I proposed, and got my\\nmother\\'s gown,--seven yards at 6_s._ 6_d._ I then walked into No. 10,\\nwhich is all dirt and confusion, but in a very promising way; and after\\nbeing present at the opening of a new account, to my great amusement,\\nHenry and I went to the exhibition in Spring Gardens. It is not thought\\na good collection, but I was very well pleased, particularly (pray tell\\nFanny) with a small portrait of Mrs. Bingley,[1] excessively like her.\\n\\nI went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there was no Mrs.\\nDarcy.[18] Perhaps, however, I may find her in the great exhibition,\\nwhich we shall go to if we have time. I have no chance of her in the\\ncollection of Sir Joshua Reynolds\\'s paintings, which is now showing in\\nPall Mall, and which we are also to visit.\\n\\nMrs. Bingley\\'s is exactly herself,--size, shaped face, features, and\\nsweetness; there never was a greater likeness. She is dressed in a white\\ngown, with green ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\\nsupposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I dare say Mrs. D.\\nwill be in yellow.\\n\\nFriday was our worst day as to weather. We were out in a very long and\\nvery heavy storm of hail, and there had been others before, but I heard\\nno thunder. Saturday was a good deal better; dry and cold.\\n\\nI gave 2_s._ 6_d._ for the dimity. I do not boast of any bargains, but\\nthink both the sarsenet and dimity good of their sort.\\n\\nI have bought your locket, but was obliged to give 18_s._ for it, which\\nmust be rather more than you intended. It is neat and plain, set in\\ngold.\\n\\nWe were to have gone to the Somerset House Exhibition on Saturday, but\\nwhen I reached Henrietta Street Mr. Hampson was wanted there, and Mr.\\nTilson and I were obliged to drive about town after him, and by the time\\nwe had done it was too late for anything but home. We never found him\\nafter all.\\n\\nI have been interrupted by Mrs. Tilson. Poor woman! She is in danger of\\nnot being able to attend Lady Drummond Smith\\'s party to-night. Miss\\nBurdett was to have taken her, and now Miss Burdett has a cough and\\nwill not go. My cousin Caroline is her sole dependence.\\n\\nThe events of yesterday were, our going to Belgrave Chapel in the\\nmorning, our being prevented by the rain from going to evening service\\nat St. James, Mr. Hampson\\'s calling, Messrs. Barlow and Phillips dining\\nhere, and Mr. and Mrs. Tilson\\'s coming in the evening _à l\\'ordinaire_.\\nShe drank tea with us both Thursday and Saturday; he dined out each day,\\nand on Friday we were with them, and they wish us to go to them\\nto-morrow evening, to meet Miss Burdett, but I do not know how it will\\nend. Henry talks of a drive to Hampstead, which may interfere with it.\\n\\nI should like to see Miss Burdett very well, but that I am rather\\nfrightened by hearing that she wishes to be introduced to me. If I am a\\nwild beast, I cannot help it. It is not my own fault.\\n\\nThere is no change in our plan of leaving London, but we shall not be\\nwith you before Tuesday. Henry thinks Monday would appear too early a\\nday. There is no danger of our being induced to stay longer.\\n\\nI have not quite determined how I shall manage about my clothes; perhaps\\nthere may be only my trunk to send by the coach, or there may be a\\nband-box with it. I have taken your gentle hint, and written to Mrs.\\nHill.\\n\\nThe Hoblyns want us to dine with them, but we have refused. When Henry\\nreturns he will be dining out a great deal, I dare say; as he will then\\nbe alone, it will be more desirable; he will be more welcome at every\\ntable, and every invitation more welcome to him. He will not want either\\nof us again till he is settled in Henrietta Street. This is my present\\npersuasion. And he will not be settled there--really settled--till late\\nin the autumn; \"he will not be come to bide\" till after September.\\n\\nThere is a gentleman in treaty for this house. Gentleman himself is in\\nthe country, but gentleman\\'s friend came to see it the other day, and\\nseemed pleased on the whole. Gentleman would rather prefer an increased\\nrent to parting with five hundred guineas at once, and if that is the\\nonly difficulty it will not be minded. Henry is indifferent as to the\\nwhich.\\n\\nGet us the best weather you can for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We\\nare to go to Windsor in our way to Henley, which will be a great\\ndelight. We shall be leaving Sloane Street about twelve, two or three\\nhours after Charles\\'s party have begun their journey. You will miss\\nthem, but the comfort of getting back into your own room will be great.\\nAnd then the tea and sugar!\\n\\nI fear Miss Clewes is not better, or you would have mentioned it. I\\nshall not write again unless I have any unexpected communication or\\nopportunity to tempt me. I enclose Mr. Herington\\'s bill and receipt.\\n\\nI am very much obliged to Fanny for her letter; it made me laugh\\nheartily, but I cannot pretend to answer it. Even had I more time, I\\nshould not feel at all sure of the sort of letter that Miss D.[19] would\\nwrite. I hope Miss Benn is got well again, and will have a comfortable\\ndinner with you to-day.\\n\\n_Monday Evening._--We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\\nReynolds\\'s, and I am disappointed, for there was nothing like Mrs. D. at\\neither. I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too\\nmuch to like it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine he\\nwould have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of love, pride, and\\ndelicacy.\\n\\nSetting aside this disappointment, I had great amusement among the\\npictures; and the driving about, the carriage being open, was very\\npleasant. I liked my solitary elegance very much, and was ready to laugh\\nall the time at my being where I was. I could not but feel that I had\\nnaturally small right to be parading about London in a barouche.\\n\\nHenry desires Edward may know that he has just bought three dozen of\\nclaret for him (cheap), and ordered it to be sent down to Chawton.\\n\\nI should not wonder if we got no farther than Reading on Thursday\\nevening, and so reach Steventon only to a reasonable dinner-hour the\\nnext day; but whatever I may write or you may imagine, we know it will\\nbe something different. I shall be quiet to-morrow morning; all my\\nbusiness is done, and I shall only call again upon Mrs. Hoblyn, etc.\\n\\nLove to your much . . . party.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,\\n                                                     J.

       "  'text': 'HENRIETTA ST., Wednesday (Sept. 15, ½ past 8).\\n\\nHERE I am, my dearest Cassandra, seated in the breakfast, dining,\\nsitting room, beginning with all my might. Fanny will join me as soon as\\nshe is dressed, and begin her letter.\\n\\nWe had a very good journey, weather and roads excellent; the three first\\nstages for 1_s._ 6_d._, and our only misadventure the being delayed\\nabout a quarter of an hour at Kingston for horses, and being obliged to\\nput up with a pair belonging to a hackney coach and their coachman,\\nwhich left no room on the barouche box for Lizzy, who was to have gone\\nher last stage there as she did the first; consequently we were all\\nfour within, which was a little crowded.\\n\\nWe arrived at a quarter-past four, and were kindly welcomed by the\\ncoachman, and then by his master, and then by William, and then by Mrs.\\nPengird, who all met us before we reached the foot of the stairs. Mde.\\nBigion was below dressing us a most comfortable dinner of soup, fish,\\nbouillée, partridges, and an apple tart, which we sat down to soon after\\nfive, after cleaning and dressing ourselves, and feeling that we were\\nmost commodiously disposed of. The little adjoining dressing-room to our\\napartment makes Fanny and myself very well off indeed, and as we have\\npoor Eliza\\'s[20] bed our space is ample every way.\\n\\nSace arrived safely about half-past six. At seven we set off in a coach\\nfor the Lyceum; were at home again in about four hours and a half; had\\nsoup and wine and water, and then went to our holes.\\n\\nEdward finds his quarters very snug and quiet. I must get a softer pen.\\nThis is harder. I am in agonies. I have not yet seen Mr. Crabbe.\\nMartha\\'s letter is gone to the post.\\n\\nI am going to write nothing but short sentences. There shall be two full\\nstops in every line. Layton and Shear\\'s is Bedford House. We mean to\\nget there before breakfast if it\\'s possible; for we feel more and more\\nhow much we have to do and how little time. This house looks very nice.\\nIt seems like Sloane Street moved here. I believe Henry is just rid of\\nSloane Street. Fanny does not come, but I have Edward seated by me\\nbeginning a letter, which looks natural.\\n\\nHenry has been suffering from the pain in the face which he has been\\nsubject to before. He caught cold at Matlock, and since his return has\\nbeen paying a little for past pleasure. It is nearly removed now, but he\\nlooks thin in the face, either from the pain or the fatigues of his\\ntour, which must have been great.\\n\\nLady Robert is delighted with P. and P.,[21] and really was so, as I\\nunderstand, before she knew who wrote it, for of course she knows now.\\nHe told her with as much satisfaction as if it were my wish. He did not\\ntell me this, but he told Fanny. And Mr. Hastings! I am quite delighted\\nwith what such a man writes about it. Henry sent him the books after his\\nreturn from Daylesford, but you will hear the letter too.\\n\\nLet me be rational, and return to my two full stops.\\n\\nI talked to Henry at the play last night. We were in a private box,--Mr.\\nSpencer\\'s,--which made it much more pleasant. The box is directly on\\nthe stage. One is infinitely less fatigued than in the common way. But\\nHenry\\'s plans are not what one could wish. He does not mean to be at\\nChawton till the 29th. He must be in town again by Oct. 5. His plan is\\nto get a couple of days of pheasant shooting and then return directly.\\nHis wish was to bring you back with him. I have told him your scruples.\\nHe wishes you to suit yourself as to time, and if you cannot come till\\nlater, will send for you at any time as far as Bagshot. He presumed you\\nwould not find difficulty in getting so far. I could not say you would.\\nHe proposed your going with him into Oxfordshire. It was his own thought\\nat first. I could not but catch at it for you.\\n\\nWe have talked of it again this morning (for now we have breakfasted),\\nand I am convinced that if you can make it suit in other respects you\\nneed not scruple on his account. If you cannot come back with him on the\\n3rd or 4th, therefore, I do hope you will contrive to go to Adlestrop.\\nBy not beginning your absence till about the middle of this month I\\nthink you may manage it very well. But you will think all this over. One\\ncould wish he had intended to come to you earlier, but it cannot be\\nhelped.\\n\\nI said nothing to him of Mrs. H. and Miss B., that he might not suppose\\ndifficulties. Shall not you put them into our own room? This seems to\\nme the best plan, and the maid will be most conveniently near.\\n\\nOh, dear me! when I shall ever have done. We did go to Layton and\\nShear\\'s before breakfast. Very pretty English poplins at 4_s._ 3_d._;\\nIrish, ditto at 6_s._; more pretty, certainly,--beautiful.\\n\\nFanny and the two little girls are gone to take places for to-night at\\nCovent Garden; \"Clandestine Marriage\" and \"Midas.\" The latter will be a\\nfine show for L. and M.[22] They revelled last night in \"Don Juan,\" whom\\nwe left in hell at half-past eleven. We had scaramouch and a ghost, and\\nwere delighted. I speak of them; my delight was very tranquil, and the\\nrest of us were sober-minded. \"Don Juan\" was the last of three musical\\nthings. \"Five Hours at Brighton,\" in three acts,--of which one was over\\nbefore we arrived, none the worse,--and the \"Beehive,\" rather less flat\\nand trumpery.\\n\\nI have this moment received 5_l._ from kind, beautiful Edward. Fanny has\\na similar gift. I shall save what I can of it for your better leisure in\\nthis place. My letter was from Miss Sharpe,--nothing particular. A\\nletter from Fanny Cage this morning.\\n\\n_Four o\\'clock._--We are just come back from doing Mrs. Tickars, Miss\\nHare, and Mr. Spence. Mr. Hall is here, and while Fanny is under his\\nhands, I will try to write a little more.\\n\\nMiss Hare had some pretty caps, and is to make me one like one of them,\\nonly white satin instead of blue. It will be white satin and lace, and a\\nlittle white flower perking out of the left ear, like Harriot Byron\\'s\\nfeather. I have allowed her to go as far as 1_l._ 16_s._ My gown is to\\nbe trimmed everywhere with white ribbon plaited on somehow or other. She\\nsays it will look well. I am not sanguine. They trim with white very\\nmuch.\\n\\nI learnt from Mrs. Tickars\\'s young lady, to my high amusement, that the\\nstays now are not made to force the bosom up at all; that was a very\\nunbecoming, unnatural fashion. I was really glad to hear that they are\\nnot to be so much off the shoulders as they were.\\n\\nGoing to Mr. Spence\\'s was a sad business, and cost us many tears;\\nunluckily we were obliged to go a second time before he could do more\\nthan just look. We went first at half-past twelve and afterwards at\\nthree; papa with us each time; and, alas! we are to go again to-morrow.\\nLizzy is not finished yet. There have been no teeth taken out, however,\\nnor will be, I believe; but he finds hers in a very bad state, and seems\\nto think particularly ill of their durableness. They have been all\\ncleaned, hers filed, and are to be filed again. There is a very sad hole\\nbetween two of her front teeth.\\n\\n_Thursday Morning, half-past Seven._--Up and dressed and downstairs in\\norder to finish my letter in time for the parcel. At eight I have an\\nappointment with Madame B., who wants to show me something downstairs.\\nAt nine we are to set off for Grafton House, and get that over before\\nbreakfast. Edward is so kind as to walk there with us. We are to be at\\nMr. Spence\\'s again at 11.5: from that time shall be driving about I\\nsuppose till four o\\'clock at least. We are, if possible, to call on Mrs.\\nTilson.\\n\\nMr. Hall was very punctual yesterday, and curled me out at a great rate.\\nI thought it looked hideous, and longed for a snug cap instead, but my\\ncompanions silenced me by their admiration. I had only a bit of velvet\\nround my head. I did not catch cold, however. The weather is all in my\\nfavor. I have had no pain in my face since I left you.\\n\\nWe had very good places in the box next the stage-box, front and second\\nrow; the three old ones behind, of course. I was particularly\\ndisappointed at seeing nothing of Mr. Crabbe. I felt sure of him when I\\nsaw that the boxes were fitted up with crimson velvet. The new Mr. Terry\\nwas Lord Ogleby, and Henry thinks he may do; but there was no acting\\nmore than moderate, and I was as much amused by the remembrances\\nconnected with \"Midas\" as with any part of it. The girls were very much\\ndelighted, but still prefer \"Don Juan;\" and I must say that I have seen\\nnobody on the stage who has been a more interesting character than that\\ncompound of cruelty and lust.\\n\\nIt was not possible for me to get the worsteds yesterday. I heard Edward\\nlast night pressing Henry to come to you, and I think Henry engaged to\\ngo there after his November collection. Nothing has been done as to S.\\nand S.[23] The books came to hand too late for him to have time for it\\nbefore he went. Mr. Hastings never hinted at Eliza in the smallest\\ndegree. Henry knew nothing of Mr. Trimmer\\'s death. I tell you these\\nthings that you may not have to ask them over again.\\n\\nThere is a new clerk sent down to Alton, a Mr. Edmund Williams, a young\\nman whom Henry thinks most highly of, and he turns out to be a son of\\nthe luckless Williamses of Grosvenor Place.\\n\\nI long to have you hear Mr. H.\\'s opinion of P. and P. His admiring my\\nElizabeth so much is particularly welcome to me.\\n\\nInstead of saving my superfluous wealth for you to spend, I am going to\\ntreat myself with spending it myself. I hope, at least, that I shall\\nfind some poplin at Layton and Shear\\'s that will tempt me to buy it. If\\nI do, it shall be sent to Chawton, as half will be for you; for I depend\\nupon your being so kind as to accept it, being the main point. It will\\nbe a great pleasure to me. Don\\'t say a word. I only wish you could\\nchoose too. I shall send twenty yards.\\n\\nNow for Bath. Poor F. Cage has suffered a good deal from her accident.\\nThe noise of the White Hart was terrible to her. They will keep her\\nquiet, I dare say. She is not so much delighted with the place as the\\nrest of the party; probably, as she says herself, from having been less\\nwell, but she thinks she should like it better in the season. The\\nstreets are very empty now, and the shops not so gay as she expected.\\nThey are at No. 1 Henrietta Street, the corner of Laura Place, and have\\nno acquaintance at present but the Bramstons.\\n\\nLady Bridges drinks at the Cross Bath, her son at the Hot, and Louisa is\\ngoing to bathe. Dr. Parry seems to be half starving Mr. Bridges, for he\\nis restricted to much such a diet as James\\'s, bread, water and meat, and\\nis never to eat so much of that as he wishes, and he is to walk a great\\ndeal,--walk till he drops, I believe,--gout or no gout. It really is to\\nthat purpose. I have not exaggerated.\\n\\nCharming weather for you and us, and the travellers, and everybody. You\\nwill take your walk this afternoon, and . . .\\n\\n  Henrietta Street, the autumn of 1813.\\n    Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.\\n      By favor of Mr. Gray.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES:\\n\\n[20] Eliza, Henry Austen\\'s first wife, who had died in the earlier part\\nof this year.\\n\\n[21] \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\\n\\n[22] Lizzy and Marianne.\\n\\n[23] \"Sense and Sensibility.\"'},\n",

I hope you have had it by this time, and that it has found\\nyou all well, and my mother no more in need of leeches. Whether this\\nwill be delivered to you by Henry on Saturday evening, or by the postman\\non Sunday morning, I know not, as he has lately recollected something of\\nan engagement for Saturday, which perhaps may delay his visit. He seems\\ndetermined to come to you soon, however.\\n\\nI hope you will receive the gown to-morrow, and may be able with\\ntolerable honesty to say that you like the color. It was bought at\\nGrafton House, where, by going very early, we got immediate attendance\\nand went on very comfortably. I only forgot the one particular thing\\nwhich I had always resolved to buy there,--a white silk\\nhandkerchief,--and was therefore obliged to give six shillings for one\\nat Crook and Besford's; which reminds me to say that the worsteds ought\\nalso to be at Chawton to-morrow, and that I shall be very happy to hear\\nthey are approved. I had not much time for deliberation.\\n\\nWe are now all four of us young ladies sitting round the circular table\\nin the inner room writing our letters, while the two brothers are\\nhaving a comfortable coze in the room adjoining. It is to be a quiet\\nevening, much to the satisfaction of four of the six. My eyes are quite\\ntired of dust and lamps.\\n\\nThe letter you forwarded from Edward, junr., has been duly received. He\\nhas been shooting most prosperously at home, and dining at Chilham\\nCastle and with Mr. Scudamore.\\n\\nMy cap is come home, and I like it very much. Fanny has one also; hers\\nis white sarsenet and lace, of a different shape from mine, more fit for\\nmorning carriage wear, which is what it is intended for, and is in shape\\nexceedingly like our own satin and lace of last winter; shaped round the\\nface exactly like it, with pipes and more fulness, and a round crown\\ninserted behind. My cap has a peak in front. Large full bows of very\\nnarrow ribbon (old twopenny) are the thing. One over the right temple,\\nperhaps, and another at the left ear.\\n\\nHenry is not quite well. His stomach is rather deranged. You must keep\\nhim in rhubarb, and give him plenty of port and water. He caught his\\ncold farther back than I told you,--before he got to Matlock, somewhere\\nin his journey from the North; but the ill effects of that I hope are\\nnearly gone.\\n\\nWe returned from Grafton House only just in time for breakfast, and had\\nscarcely finished breakfast when the carriage came to the door. From\\neleven to half-past three we were hard at it; we did contrive to get to\\nHans Place for ten minutes. Mrs. T. was as affectionate and pleasing as\\never.\\n\\nAfter our return Mr. Tilson walked up from the Compting House and called\\nupon us, and these have been all our visitings.\\n\\nI have rejoiced more than once that I bought my writing-paper in the\\ncountry; we have not had a quarter of an hour to spare.\\n\\nI enclose the eighteen-pence due to my mother. The rose color was 6_s._\\nand the other 4_s._ per yard. There was but two yards and a quarter of\\nthe dark slate in the shop, but the man promised to match it and send it\\noff correctly.\\n\\nFanny bought her Irish at Newton's in Leicester Square, and I took the\\nopportunity of thinking about your Irish, and seeing one piece of the\\nyard wide at 4_s._, and it seemed to me very good; good enough for your\\npurpose. It might at least be worth your while to go there, if you have\\nno other engagements. Fanny is very much pleased with the stockings she\\nhas bought of Remmington, silk at 12_s._, cotton at 4_s._ 3_d._ She\\nthinks them great bargains, but I have not seen them yet, as my hair was\\ndressing when the man and the stockings came.\\n\\nThe poor girls and their teeth! I have not mentioned them yet, but we\\nwere a whole hour at Spence's, and Lizzy's were filed and lamented over\\nagain, and poor Marianne had two taken out after all, the two just\\nbeyond the eye teeth, to make room for those in front. When her doom was\\nfixed, Fanny, Lizzy, and I walked into the next room, where we heard\\neach of the two sharp and hasty screams.\\n\\nThe little girls' teeth I can suppose in a critical state, but I think\\nhe must be a lover of teeth and money and mischief, to parade about\\nFanny's. I would not have had him look at mine for a shilling a tooth\\nand double it. It was a disagreeable hour.\\n\\nWe then went to Wedgwood's, where my brother and Fanny chose a\\ndinner-set. I believe the pattern is a small lozenge in purple, between\\nlines of narrow gold, and it is to have the crest.\\n\\nWe must have been three-quarters of an hour at Grafton House, Edward\\nsitting by all the time with wonderful patience. There Fanny bought the\\nnet for Anna's gown, and a beautiful square veil for herself. The edging\\nthere is very cheap. I was tempted by some, and I bought some very nice\\nplaiting lace at 3_s._ 4_d._\\n\\nFanny desires me to tell Martha, with her kind love, that Birchall\\nassured her there was no second set of Hook's Lessons for Beginners, and\\nthat, by my advice, she has therefore chosen her a set by another\\ncomposer. I thought she would rather have something than not. It costs\\nsix shillings.\\n\\nWith love to you all, including Triggs, I remain,\\n\\n                            Yours very affectionately,       J.

It is so rich in striking\\nintelligence that I hardly know what to reply to first. I believe finery\\nmust have it.\\n\\nI am extremely glad that you like the poplin. I thought it would have my\\nmother's approbation, but was not so confident of yours. Remember that\\nit is a present. Do not refuse me. I am very rich.\\n\\nMrs. Clement is very welcome to her little boy, and to my\\ncongratulations into the bargain, if ever you think of giving them. I\\nhope she will do well. Her sister in Lucina, Mrs. H. Gipps, does too\\nwell, we think. Mary P. wrote on Sunday that she had been three days on\\nthe sofa. Sackree does not approve it.\\n\\nWell, there is some comfort in the Mrs. Hulbart's not coming to you, and\\nI am happy to hear of the honey. I was thinking of it the other day. Let\\nme know when you begin the new tea and the new white wine. My present\\nelegances have not yet made me indifferent to such matters. I am still a\\ncat if I see a mouse.\\n\\nI am glad you like our caps, but Fanny is out of conceit with hers\\nalready; she finds that she has been buying a new cap without having a\\nnew pattern, which is true enough. She is rather out of luck to like\\nneither her gown nor her cap, but I do not much mind it, because besides\\nthat I like them both myself, I consider it as a thing of course at her\\ntime of life,--one of the sweet taxes of youth to choose in a hurry and\\nmake bad bargains.\\n\\nI wrote to Charles yesterday, and Fanny has had a letter from him\\nto-day, principally to make inquiries about the time of their visit\\nhere, to which mine was an answer beforehand; so he will probably write\\nagain soon to fix his week. I am best pleased that Cassy does not go to\\nyou.\\n\\nNow, what have we been doing since I wrote last? The Mr. K.'s[24] came a\\nlittle before dinner on Monday, and Edward went to the church with the\\ntwo seniors, but there is no inscription yet drawn up. They are very\\ngood-natured, you know, and civil, and all that, but are not\\nparticularly superfine; however, they ate their dinner and drank their\\ntea, and went away, leaving their lovely Wadham in our arms, and I wish\\nyou had seen Fanny and me running backwards and forwards with his\\nbreeches from the little chintz to the white room before we went to bed,\\nin the greatest of frights lest he should come upon us before we had\\ndone it all. There had been a mistake in the housemaid's preparation,\\nand they were gone to bed.\\n\\nHe seems a very harmless sort of young man, nothing to like or dislike\\nin him,--goes out shooting or hunting with the two others all the\\nmorning, and plays at whist and makes queer faces in the evening. . . .\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[24] Knatchbulls.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'GODMERSHAM PARK, Monday (Oct. 11).\\n\\n[MY DEAREST AUNT CASS.,--I have just asked Aunt Jane to let me write a\\nlittle in her letter, but she does not like it, so I won\\'t. Good-by!]\\n\\nYou will have Edward\\'s letter to-morrow. He tells me that he did not\\nsend you any news to interfere with mine, but I do not think there is\\nmuch for anybody to send at present.\\n\\nWe had our dinner-party on Wednesday, with the addition of Mrs. and Miss\\nMilles, who were under a promise of dining here in their return from\\nEastwell, whenever they paid their visit of duty there, and it happened\\nto be paid on that day. Both mother and daughter are much as I have\\nalways found them. I like the mother--first, because she reminds me of\\nMrs. Birch; and, secondly, because she is cheerful and grateful for what\\nshe is at the age of ninety and upwards. The day was pleasant enough. I\\nsat by Mr. Chisholme, and we talked away at a great rate about nothing\\nworth hearing.\\n\\nIt was a mistake as to the day of the Sherers going being fixed; they\\nare ready, but are waiting for Mr. Paget\\'s answer.\\n\\nI inquired of Mrs. Milles after Jemima Brydges, and was quite grieved to\\nhear that she was obliged to leave Canterbury some months ago on account\\nof her debts, and is nobody knows where. What an unprosperous family!\\n\\nOn Saturday, soon after breakfast, Mr. J. P. left us for Norton Court. I\\nlike him very much. He gives me the idea of a very amiable young man,\\nonly too diffident to be so agreeable as he might be. He was out the\\nchief of each morning with the other two, shooting and getting wet\\nthrough. To-morrow we are to know whether he and a hundred young ladies\\nwill come here for the ball. I do not much expect any.\\n\\nThe Deedes cannot meet us; they have engagements at home. I will finish\\nthe Deedes by saying that they are not likely to come here till quite\\nlate in my stay,--the very last week perhaps; and I do not expect to see\\nthe Moores at all. They are not solicited till after Edward\\'s return\\nfrom Hampshire.\\n\\nMonday, November 15, is the day now fixed for our setting out.\\n\\nPoor Basingstoke races! There seem to have been two particularly\\nwretched days on purpose for them; and Weyhill week does not begin much\\nhappier.\\n\\nWe were quite surprised by a letter from Anna at Tollard Royal, last\\nSaturday; but perfectly approve her going, and only regret they should\\nall go so far to stay so few days.\\n\\nWe had thunder and lightning here on Thursday morning, between five and\\nseven; no very bad thunder, but a great deal of lightning. It has given\\nthe commencement of a season of wind and rain, and perhaps for the next\\nsix weeks we shall not have two dry days together.\\n\\nLizzy is very much obliged to you for your letter and will answer it\\nsoon, but has so many things to do that it may be four or five days\\nbefore she can. This is quite her own message, spoken in rather a\\ndesponding tone. Your letter gave pleasure to all of us; we had all the\\nreading of it of course,--I three times, as I undertook, to the great\\nrelief of Lizzy, to read it to Sackree, and afterwards to Louisa.\\n\\nSackree does not at all approve of Mary Doe and her nuts,--on the score\\nof propriety rather than health. She saw some signs of going after her\\nin George and Henry, and thinks if you could give the girl a check, by\\nrather reproving her for taking anything seriously about nuts which they\\nsaid to her, it might be of use. This, of course, is between our three\\ndiscreet selves, a scene of triennial bliss.\\n\\nMrs. Breton called here on Saturday. I never saw her before. She is a\\nlarge, ungenteel woman, with self-satisfied and would-be elegant\\nmanners.\\n\\nWe are certain of some visitors to-morrow. Edward Bridges comes for two\\nnights in his way from Lenham to Ramsgate, and brings a friend--name\\nunknown--but supposed to be a Mr. Harpur, a neighboring clergyman; and\\nMr. R. Mascall is to shoot with the young men, which it is to be\\nsupposed will end in his staying dinner.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Mr. Lushington, M.P. for Canterbury, and manager of the\\nLodge Hounds, dines here, and stays the night. He is chiefly young\\nEdward\\'s acquaintance. If I can I will get a frank from him, and write\\nto you all the sooner. I suppose the Ashford ball will furnish\\nsomething.\\n\\nAs I wrote of my nephews with a little bitterness in my last, I think\\nit particularly incumbent on me to do them justice now, and I have great\\npleasure in saying that they were both at the Sacrament yesterday. After\\nhaving much praised or much blamed anybody, one is generally sensible of\\nsomething just the reverse soon afterwards. Now these two boys who are\\nout with the foxhounds will come home and disgust me again by some habit\\nof luxury or some proof of sporting mania, unless I keep it off by this\\nprediction. They amuse themselves very comfortably in the evening by\\nnetting; they are each about a rabbit net, and sit as deedily to it,\\nside by side, as any two Uncle Franks could do.\\n\\nI am looking over \"Self-Control\" again, and my opinion is confirmed of\\nits being an excellently meant, elegantly written work, without anything\\nof nature or probability in it. I declare I do not know whether Laura\\'s\\npassage down the American river is not the most natural, possible,\\nevery-day thing she ever does.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--Dear me! what is to become of me? Such a long letter!\\nTwo-and-forty lines in the second page. Like Harriot Byron, I ask, what\\nam I to do with my gratitude? I can do nothing but thank you and go on.\\nA few of your inquiries, I think, are replied to _en avance_.\\n\\nThe name of F. Cage\\'s drawing-master is O\\'Neil. We are exceedingly\\namused with your Shalden news, and your self-reproach on the subject of\\nMrs. Stockwell made me laugh heartily. I rather wondered that\\nJohncock,[25] the only person in the room, could help laughing too. I had\\nnot heard before of her having the measles. Mrs. H. and Alethea\\'s\\nstaying till Friday was quite new to me; a good plan, however. I could\\nnot have settled it better myself, and am glad they found so much in the\\nhouse to approve, and I hope they will ask Martha to visit them. I\\nadmire the sagacity and taste of Charlotte Williams. Those large dark\\neyes always judge well. I will compliment her by naming a heroine after\\nher.\\n\\nEdward has had all the particulars of the building, etc., read to him\\ntwice over, and seems very well satisfied. A narrow door to the pantry\\nis the only subject of solicitude; it is certainly just the door which\\nshould not be narrow, on account of the trays; but if a case of\\nnecessity, it must be borne.\\n\\nI knew there was sugar in the tin, but had no idea of there being enough\\nto last through your company. All the better. You ought not to think\\nthis new loaf better than the other, because that was the first of five\\nwhich all came together. Something of fancy, perhaps, and something of\\nimagination.\\n\\nDear Mrs. Digweed! I cannot bear that she should not be foolishly happy\\nafter a ball. I hope Miss Yates and her companions were all well the day\\nafter their arrival. I am thoroughly rejoiced that Miss Benn has placed\\nherself in lodgings, though I hope they may not be long necessary.\\n\\nNo letter from Charles yet.\\n\\nSouthey\\'s \"Life of Nelson.\" I am tired of \"Lives of Nelson,\" being that\\nI never read any. I will read this, however, if Frank is mentioned in\\nit.\\n\\nHere am I in Kent, with one brother in the same county and another\\nbrother\\'s wife, and see nothing of them, which seems unnatural. It will\\nnot last so forever, I trust. I should like to have Mrs. F. A. and her\\nchildren here for a week, but not a syllable of that nature is ever\\nbreathed. I wish her last visit had not been so long a one.\\n\\nI wonder whether Mrs. Tilson has ever lain-in. Mention it if it ever\\ncomes to your knowledge, and we shall hear of it by the same post from\\nHenry.\\n\\nMr. Rob. Mascall breakfasted here; he eats a great deal of butter. I\\ndined upon goose yesterday, which, I hope, will secure a good sale of my\\nsecond edition. Have you any tomatas? Fanny and I regale on them every\\nday.\\n\\nDisastrous letters from the Plumptres and Oxendens. Refusals\\neverywhere--a blank _partout_--and it is not quite certain whether we go\\nor not; something may depend upon the disposition of Uncle Edward when\\nhe comes, and upon what we hear at Chilham Castle this morning, for we\\nare going to pay visits. We are going to each house at Chilham and to\\nMystole. I shall like seeing the Faggs. I shall like it all, except that\\nwe are to set out so early that I have not time to write as I would\\nwish.\\n\\nEdwd. Bridges\\'s friend is a Mr. Hawker, I find, not Harpur. I would not\\nhave you sleep in such an error for the world.\\n\\nMy brother desires his best love and thanks for all your information. He\\nhopes the roots of the old beech have been dug away enough to allow a\\nproper covering of mould and turf. He is sorry for the necessity of\\nbuilding the new coin, but hopes they will contrive that the doorway\\nshould be of the usual width,--if it must be contracted on one side, by\\nwidening it on the other. The appearance need not signify. And he\\ndesires me to say that your being at Chawton when he is will be quite\\nnecessary. You cannot think it more indispensable than he does. He is\\nvery much obliged to you for your attention to everything. Have you any\\nidea of returning with him to Henrietta Street and finishing your visit\\nthen? Tell me your sweet little innocent ideas.\\n\\nEverything of love and kindness, proper and improper, must now suffice.\\n\\n                             Yours very affectionately,      J. AUSTEN.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Chawton, Alton, Hants.\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[25] The butler at Godmersham.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'GODMERSHAM PARK, Thursday (Oct. 14).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Now I will prepare for Mr. Lushington, and as it\\nwill be wisest also to prepare for his not coming, or my not getting a\\nfrank, I shall write very close from the first, and even leave room for\\nthe seal in the proper place. When I have followed up my last with this\\nI shall feel somewhat less unworthy of you than the state of our\\ncorrespondence now requires.\\n\\nI left off in a great hurry to prepare for our morning visits. Of course\\nwas ready a good deal the first, and need not have hurried so much.\\nFanny wore her new gown and cap. I was surprised to find Mystole so\\npretty.\\n\\nThe ladies were at home. I was in luck, and saw Lady Fagg and all her\\nfive daughters, with an old Mrs. Hamilton, from Canterbury, and Mrs. and\\nMiss Chapman, from Margate, into the bargain. I never saw so plain a\\nfamily,--five sisters so very plain! They are as plain as the Foresters,\\nor the Franfraddops, or the Seagraves, or the Rivers, excluding Sophy.\\nMiss Sally Fagg has a pretty figure, and that comprises all the good\\nlooks of the family.\\n\\nIt was stupidish; Fanny did her part very well, but there was a lack of\\ntalk altogether, and the three friends in the house only sat by and\\nlooked at us. However, Miss Chapman\\'s name is Laura, and she had a\\ndouble flounce to her gown. You really must get some flounces. Are not\\nsome of your large stock of white morning gowns just in a happy state\\nfor a flounce--too short? Nobody at home at either house in Chilham.\\n\\nEdward Bridges and his friend did not forget to arrive. The friend is a\\nMr. Wigram, one of the three-and-twenty children of a great rich\\nmercantile, Sir Robert Wigram, an old acquaintance of the Footes, but\\nvery recently known to Edward B. The history of his coming here is,\\nthat, intending to go from Ramsgate to Brighton, Edw. B. persuaded him\\nto take Lenham on his way, which gave him the convenience of Mr. W.\\'s\\ngig, and the comfort of not being alone there; but, probably thinking a\\nfew days of Gm. would be the cheapest and pleasantest way of\\nentertaining his friend and himself, offered a visit here, and here they\\nstay till to-morrow.\\n\\nMr. W. is about five or six-and-twenty, not ill-looking, and not\\nagreeable. He is certainly no addition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike\\nmanner, but very silent. They say his name is Henry, a proof how\\nunequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed. I have seen many a John and\\nThomas much more agreeable.\\n\\nWe have got rid of Mr. R. Mascall, however. I did not like him, either.\\nHe talks too much, and is conceited, besides having a vulgarly shaped\\nmouth. He slept here on Tuesday, so that yesterday Fanny and I sat down\\nto breakfast with six gentlemen to admire us.\\n\\nWe did not go to the ball. It was left to her to decide, and at last she\\ndetermined against it. She knew that it would be a sacrifice on the part\\nof her father and brothers if they went, and I hope it will prove that\\nshe has not sacrificed much. It is not likely that there should have\\nbeen anybody there whom she would care for. I was very glad to be spared\\nthe trouble of dressing and going, and being weary before it was half\\nover; so my gown and my cap are still unworn. It will appear at last,\\nperhaps, that I might have done without either. I produced my brown\\nbombazine yesterday, and it was very much admired indeed, and I like it\\nbetter than ever.\\n\\nYou have given many particulars of the state of Chawton House, but still\\nwe want more. Edward wants to be expressly told that all the round\\ntower, etc., is entirely down, and the door from the best room stopped\\nup; he does not know enough of the appearance of things in that quarter.\\n\\nHe heard from Bath yesterday. Lady B. continues very well, and Dr.\\nParry\\'s opinion is, that while the water agrees with her she ought to\\nremain there, which throws their coming away at a greater uncertainty\\nthan we had supposed. It will end, perhaps, in a fit of the gout, which\\nmay prevent her coming away. Louisa thinks her mother\\'s being so well\\nmay be quite as much owing to her being so much out of doors as to the\\nwater. Lady B. is going to try the hot pump, the Cross bath being about\\nto be painted. Louisa is particularly well herself, and thinks the water\\nhas been of use to her. She mentioned our inquiries, etc., to Mr. and\\nMrs. Alex. Evelyn, and had their best compliments and thanks to give in\\nreturn. Dr. Parry does not expect Mr. E. to last much longer.\\n\\nOnly think of Mrs. Holder\\'s being dead! Poor woman, she has done the\\nonly thing in the world she could possibly do to make one cease to abuse\\nher. Now, if you please, Hooper must have it in his power to do more by\\nhis uncle. Lucky for the little girl. An Anne Ekins can hardly be so\\nunfit for the care of a child as a Mrs. Holder.\\n\\nA letter from Wrotham yesterday offering an early visit here, and Mr.\\nand Mrs. Moore and one child are to come on Monday for ten days. I hope\\nCharles and Fanny may not fix the same time, but if they come at all in\\nOctober they must. What is the use of hoping? The two parties of\\nchildren is the chief evil.\\n\\nTo be sure, here we are; the very thing has happened, or rather\\nworse,--a letter from Charles this very morning, which gives us reason\\nto suppose they may come here to-day. It depends upon the weather, and\\nthe weather now is very fine. No difficulties are made, however, and,\\nindeed, there will be no want of room; but I wish there were no Wigrams\\nand Lushingtons in the way to fill up the table and make us such a\\nmotley set. I cannot spare Mr. Lushington either, because of his frank,\\nbut Mr. Wigram does no good to anybody. I cannot imagine how a man can\\nhave the impudence to come into a family party for three days, where he\\nis quite a stranger, unless he knows himself to be agreeable on\\nundoubted authority. He and Edw. B. are going to ride to Eastwell, and\\nas the boys are hunting, and my brother is gone to Canty., Fanny and I\\nhave a quiet morning before us.\\n\\nEdward has driven off poor Mrs. Salkeld. It was thought a good\\nopportunity of doing something towards clearing the house. By her own\\ndesire Mrs. Fanny[26] is to be put in the room next the nursery, her baby\\nin a little bed by her; and as Cassy is to have the closet within, and\\nBetsey William\\'s little hole, they will be all very snug together. I\\nshall be most happy to see dear Charles, and he will be as happy as he\\ncan with a cross child, or some such care, pressing on him at the time.\\nI should be very happy in the idea of seeing little Cassy again, too,\\ndid not I fear she would disappoint me by some immediate\\ndisagreeableness. . . .\\n\\nThe comfort of the billiard-table here is very great; it draws all the\\ngentlemen to it whenever they are within, especially after dinner, so\\nthat my brother, Fanny, and I have the library to ourselves in\\ndelightful quiet. There is no truth in the report of G. Hatton being to\\nmarry Miss Wemyss. He desires it may be contradicted.\\n\\nHave you done anything about our present to Miss Benn? I suppose she\\nmust have a bed at my mother\\'s whenever she dines there. How will they\\nmanage as to inviting her when you are gone? and if they invite, how\\nwill they continue to entertain her?\\n\\nLet me know as many of your parting arrangements as you can, as to wine,\\netc. I wonder whether the ink-bottle has been filled. Does butcher\\'s\\nmeat keep up at the same price, and is not bread lower than 2_s._ 6_d._?\\nMary\\'s blue gown! My mother must be in agonies. I have a great mind to\\nhave my blue gown dyed some time or other. I proposed it once to you,\\nand you made some objection, I forget what. It is the fashion of\\nflounces that gives it particular expediency.\\n\\nMrs. and Miss Wildman have just been here. Miss is very plain. I wish\\nLady B. may be returned before we leave Gm., that Fanny may spend the\\ntime of her father\\'s absence at Goodnestone, which is what she would\\nprefer.\\n\\n_Friday._--They came last night at about seven. We had given them up,\\nbut I still expected them to come. Dessert was nearly over; a better\\ntime for arriving than an hour and a half earlier. They were late\\nbecause they did not set out earlier, and did not allow time enough.\\nCharles did not aim at more than reaching Sittingbourne by three, which\\ncould not have brought them here by dinner-time. They had a very rough\\npassage; he would not have ventured if he had known how bad it would be.\\n\\nHowever, here they are, safe and well, just like their own nice selves,\\nFanny looking as neat and white this morning as possible, and dear\\nCharles all affectionate, placid, quiet, cheerful good-humor. They are\\nboth looking very well, but poor little Cassy is grown extremely thin,\\nand looks poorly. I hope a week\\'s country air and exercise may do her\\ngood. I am sorry to say it can be but a week. The baby does not appear\\nso large in proportion as she was, nor quite so pretty, but I have seen\\nvery little of her. Cassy was too tired and bewildered just at first to\\nseem to know anybody. We met them in the hall--the women and girl part\\nof us--but before we reached the library she kissed me very\\naffectionately, and has since seemed to recollect me in the same way.\\n\\nIt was quite an evening of confusion, as you may suppose. At first we\\nwere all walking about from one part of the house to the other; then\\ncame a fresh dinner in the breakfast-room for Charles and his wife,\\nwhich Fanny and I attended; then we moved into the library, were joined\\nby the dining-room people, were introduced, and so forth; and then we\\nhad tea and coffee, which was not over till past ten. Billiards again\\ndrew all the odd ones away; and Edward, Charles, the two Fannies, and I\\nsat snugly talking. I shall be glad to have our numbers a little\\nreduced, and by the time you receive this we shall be only a family,\\nthough a large family, party. Mr. Lushington goes to-morrow.\\n\\nNow I must speak of him, and I like him very much. I am sure he is\\nclever, and a man of taste. He got a volume of Milton last night, and\\nspoke of it with warmth. He is quite an M. P., very smiling, with an\\nexceeding good address and readiness of language. I am rather in love\\nwith him. I dare say he is ambitious and insincere. He puts me in mind\\nof Mr. Dundas. He has a wide smiling mouth, and very good teeth, and\\nsomething the same complexion and nose. He is a much shorter man, with\\nMartha\\'s leave. Does Martha never hear from Mrs. Craven? Is Mrs. Craven\\nnever at home?\\n\\nWe breakfasted in the dining-room to-day, and are now all pretty well\\ndispersed and quiet. Charles and George are gone out shooting together,\\nto Winnigates and Seaton Wood. I asked on purpose to tell Henry. Mr.\\nLushington and Edwd. are gone some other way. I wish Charles may kill\\nsomething; but this high wind is against their sport.\\n\\nLady Williams is living at the Rose at Sittingbourne; they called upon\\nher yesterday; she cannot live at Sheerness, and as soon as she gets to\\nSittingbourne is quite well. In return for all your matches, I announce\\nthat her brother William is going to marry a Miss Austen, of a Wiltshire\\nfamily, who say they are related to us.\\n\\nI talk to Cassy about Chawton; she remembers much, but does not\\nvolunteer on the subject. Poor little love! I wish she were not so very\\nPalmery, but it seems stronger than ever. I never knew a wife\\'s family\\nfeatures have such undue influence.\\n\\nPapa and mamma have not yet made up their mind as to parting with her or\\nnot; the chief, indeed the only, difficulty with mamma is a very\\nreasonable one, the child\\'s being very unwilling to leave them. When it\\nwas mentioned to her she did not like the idea of it at all. At the same\\ntime she has been suffering so much lately from sea-sickness that her\\nmamma cannot bear to have her much on board this winter. Charles is\\nless inclined to part with her. I do not know how it will end, or what\\nis to determine it. He desires his best love to you, and has not written\\nbecause he has not been able to decide. They are both very sensible of\\nyour kindness on the occasion.\\n\\nI have made Charles furnish me with something to say about young\\nKendall. He is going on very well. When he first joined the \"Namur,\" my\\nbrother did not find him forward enough to be what they call put in the\\noffice, and therefore placed him under the schoolmaster; but he is very\\nmuch improved, and goes into the office now every afternoon, still\\nattending school in the morning.\\n\\nThis cold weather comes very fortunately for Edward\\'s nerves, with such\\na house full; it suits him exactly; he is all alive and cheerful. Poor\\nJames, on the contrary, must be running his toes into the fire. I find\\nthat Mary Jane Fowle was very near returning with her brother and paying\\nthem a visit on board. I forget exactly what hindered her; I believe the\\nCheltenham scheme. I am glad something did. They are to go to Cheltenham\\non Monday se\\'nnight. I don\\'t vouch for their going, you know; it only\\ncomes from one of the family.\\n\\nNow I think I have written you a good-sized letter, and may deserve\\nwhatever I can get in reply. Infinities of love. I must distinguish\\nthat of Fanny, senior, who particularly desires to be remembered to you\\nall.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                          J.

       "  'text': 'GODMERSHAM PARK, Oct. 18.\\n\\nMY DEAR AUNT CASSANDRA,--I am very much obliged to you for your long\\nletter and for the nice account of Chawton. We are all very glad to hear\\nthat the Adams are gone, and hope Dame Libscombe will be more happy now\\nwith her deaffy child, as she calls it, but I am afraid there is not\\nmuch chance of her remaining long sole mistress of her house.\\n\\nI am sorry you had not any better news to send us of our hare, poor\\nlittle thing! I thought it would not live long in that _Pondy House_; I\\ndon\\'t wonder that Mary Doe is very sorry it is dead, because we promised\\nher that if it was alive when we came back to Chawton, we would reward\\nher for her trouble.\\n\\nPapa is much obliged to you for ordering the scrubby firs to be cut\\ndown; I think he was rather frightened at first about the great oak.\\nFanny quite believed it, for she exclaimed, \"Dear me, what a pity, how\\ncould they be so stupid!\" I hope by this time they have put up some\\nhurdles for the sheep, or turned out the cart-horses from the lawn.\\n\\nPray tell grandmamma that we have begun getting seeds for her; I hope we\\nshall be able to get her a nice collection, but I am afraid this wet\\nweather is very much against them. How glad I am to hear she has had\\nsuch good success with her chickens, but I wish there had been more\\nbantams amongst them. I am very sorry to hear of poor Lizzie\\'s fate.\\n\\nI must now tell you something about our poor people. I believe you know\\nold Mary Croucher; she gets _maderer_ and _maderer_ every day. Aunt Jane\\nhas been to see her, but it was on one of her rational days. Poor Will\\nAmos hopes your skewers are doing well; he has left his house in the\\npoor Row, and lives in a barn at Builting. We asked him why he went\\naway, and he said the fleas were so starved when he came back from\\nChawton that they all flew upon him and _eenermost_ eat him up.\\n\\nHow unlucky it is that the weather is so wet! Poor Uncle Charles has\\ncome home half drowned every day.\\n\\nI don\\'t think little Fanny is quite so pretty as she was; one reason is\\nbecause she wears short petticoats, I believe.

She agrees pretty well with her cousins,\\nbut is not quite happy among them; they are too many and too boisterous\\nfor her.

Edw.\\nand Geo. were absent,--gone for a night to Eastling. The two Fannies\\nwent to Canty. in the morning, and took Lou. and Cass. to try on new\\nstays.

Fanny\\'s best love also.\\nI fancy there is to be another party to Canty. to-morrow,--Mr. and Mrs.\\nMoore and me.\\n\\nEdward thanks Henry for his letter. We are most happy to hear he is so\\nmuch better. I depend upon you for letting me know what he wishes as to\\nmy staying with him or not; you will be able to find out, I dare say. I\\nhad intended to beg you would bring one of my nightcaps with you, in\\ncase of my staying, but forgot it when I wrote on Tuesday. Edward is\\nmuch concerned about his pond; he cannot now doubt the fact of its\\nrunning out, which he was resolved to do as long as possible.\\n\\nI suppose my mother will like to have me write to her. I shall try at\\nleast.\\n\\nNo; I have never seen the death of Mrs. Crabbe. I have only just been\\nmaking out from one of his prefaces that he probably was married. It is\\nalmost ridiculous. Poor woman! I will comfort him as well as I can, but\\nI do not undertake to be good to her children. She had better not leave\\nany.\\n\\nEdw. and Geo. set off this day week for Oxford.

       "  'text': 'GODMERSHAM PARK, Wednesday (Nov. 3).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I will keep this celebrated birthday by writing\\nto you; and as my pen seems inclined to write large, I will put my lines\\nvery close together. I had but just time to enjoy your letter yesterday\\nbefore Edward and I set off in the chair for Canty., and I allowed him\\nto hear the chief of it as we went along.\\n\\nWe rejoice sincerely in Henry\\'s gaining ground as he does, and hope\\nthere will be weather for him to get out every day this week, as the\\nlikeliest way of making him equal to what he plans for the next. If he\\nis tolerably well, the going into Oxfordshire will make him better, by\\nmaking him happier.\\n\\nCan it be that I have not given you the minutiæ of Edward\\'s plans? See,\\nhere they are: To go to Wrotham on Saturday the 13th, spend Sunday\\nthere, and be in town on Monday to dinner, and if agreeable to Henry,\\nspend one whole day with him, which day is likely to be Tuesday, and so\\ngo down to Chawton on Wednesday.\\n\\nBut now I cannot be quite easy without staying a little while with\\nHenry, unless he wishes it otherwise; his illness and the dull time of\\nyear together make me feel that it would be horrible of me not to offer\\nto remain with him, and therefore unless you know of any objection, I\\nwish you would tell him with my best love that I shall be most happy to\\nspend ten days or a fortnight in Henrietta St., if he will accept me. I\\ndo not offer more than a fortnight, because I shall then have been some\\ntime from home; but it will be a great pleasure to be with him, as it\\nalways is. I have the less regret and scruple on your account, because I\\nshall see you for a day and a half, and because you will have Edward for\\nat least a week. My scheme is to take Bookham in my way home for a few\\ndays, and my hope that Henry will be so good as to send me some part of\\nthe way thither. I have a most kind repetition of Mrs. Cooke\\'s two or\\nthree dozen invitations, with the offer of meeting me anywhere in one of\\nher airings.\\n\\nFanny\\'s cold is much better. By dosing and keeping her room on Sunday,\\nshe got rid of the worst of it, but I am rather afraid of what this day\\nmay do for her; she is gone to Canty. with Miss Clewes, Liz., and\\nMa^{rnne}, and it is but roughish weather for any one in a tender state.\\nMiss Clewes has been going to Canty. ever since her return, and it is\\nnow just accomplishing.\\n\\nEdward and I had a delightful morning for our drive there, I enjoyed it\\nthoroughly; but the day turned off before we were ready, and we came\\nhome in some rain and the apprehension of a great deal. It has not done\\nus any harm, however. He went to inspect the gaol, as a visiting\\nmagistrate, and took me with him. I was gratified, and went through all\\nthe feelings which people must go through, I think, in visiting such a\\nbuilding. We paid no other visits, only walked about snugly together,\\nand shopped. I bought a concert ticket and a sprig of flowers for my old\\nage.\\n\\nTo vary the subject from gay to grave with inimitable address, I shall\\nnow tell you something of the Bath party--and still a Bath party they\\nare, for a fit of the gout came on last week. The accounts of Lady B.\\nare as good as can be under such a circumstance; Dr. P. says it appears\\na good sort of gout, and her spirits are better than usual, but as to\\nher coming away, it is of course all uncertainty. I have very little\\ndoubt of Edward\\'s going down to Bath, if they have not left it when he\\nis in Hampshire; if he does, he will go on from Steventon, and then\\nreturn direct to London, without coming back to Chawton. This detention\\ndoes not suit his feelings. It may be rather a good thing, however, that\\nDr. P. should see Lady B. with the gout on her. Harriot was quite\\nwishing for it.\\n\\nThe day seems to improve. I wish my pen would too.\\n\\nSweet Mr. Ogle! I dare say he sees all the panoramas for nothing, has\\nfree admittance everywhere; he is so delightful! Now, you need not see\\nanybody else.\\n\\nI am glad to hear of our being likely to have a peep at Charles and\\nFanny at Christmas, but do not force poor Cass. to stay if she hates it.\\nYou have done very right as to Mrs. F. A. Your tidings of S. and S. give\\nme pleasure. I have never seen it advertised.\\n\\nHarriot, in a letter to Fanny to-day, inquires whether they sell cloths\\nfor pelisses at Bedford House, and, if they do, will be very much\\nobliged to you to desire them to send her down patterns, with the width\\nand prices; they may go from Charing Cross almost any day in the week,\\nbut if it is a ready-money house it will not do, for the _bru_ of _feu_\\nthe Archbishop says she cannot pay for it immediately. Fanny and I\\nsuspect they do not deal in the article.\\n\\nThe Sherers, I believe, are now really going to go; Joseph has had a bed\\nhere the last two nights, and I do not know whether this is not the day\\nof moving. Mrs. Sherer called yesterday to take leave. The weather looks\\nworse again.\\n\\nWe dine at Chilham Castle to-morrow, and I expect to find some\\namusement, but more from the concert the next day, as I am sure of\\nseeing several that I want to see. We are to meet a party from\\nGoodnestone, Lady B., Miss Hawley, and Lucy Foote, and I am to meet Mrs.\\nHarrison, and we are to talk about Ben and Anna. \"My dear Mrs.\\nHarrison,\" I shall say, \"I am afraid the young man has some of your\\nfamily madness; and though there often appears to be something of\\nmadness in Anna too, I think she inherits more of it from her mother\\'s\\nfamily than from ours.\" That is what I shall say, and I think she will\\nfind it difficult to answer me.\\n\\nI took up your letter again to refresh me, being somewhat tired, and was\\nstruck with the prettiness of the hand: it is really a very pretty hand\\nnow and then,--so small and so neat! I wish I could get as much into a\\nsheet of paper.[27] Another time I will take two days to make a letter\\nin: it is fatiguing to write a whole long one at once. I hope to hear\\nfrom you again on Sunday and again on Friday, the day before we move.\\nOn Monday, I suppose, you will be going to Streatham, to see quiet Mr.\\nHill and eat very bad baker\\'s bread.\\n\\nA fall in bread by the by. I hope my mother\\'s bill next week will show\\nit. I have had a very comfortable letter from her, one of her foolscap\\nsheets quite full of little home news. Anna was there the first of the\\ntwo days. An Anna sent away and an Anna fetched are different things.\\nThis will be an excellent time for Ben to pay his visit, now that we,\\nthe formidables, are absent.\\n\\nI did not mean to eat, but Mr. Johncock has brought in the tray, so I\\nmust. I am all alone. Edward is gone into his woods. At this present\\ntime I have five tables, eight-and-twenty chairs, and two fires all to\\nmyself.\\n\\nMiss Clewes is to be invited to go to the concert with us; there will be\\nmy brother\\'s place and ticket for her, as he cannot go. He and the other\\nconnections of the Cages are to meet at Milgate that very day, to\\nconsult about a proposed alteration of the Maidstone road, in which the\\nCages are very much interested. Sir Brook comes here in the morning, and\\nthey are to be joined by Mr. Deedes at Ashford. The loss of the concert\\nwill be no great evil to the Squire. We shall be a party of three ladies\\ntherefore, and to meet three ladies.\\n\\nWhat a convenient carriage Henry\\'s is, to his friends in general! Who\\nhas it next? I am glad William\\'s going is voluntary, and on no worse\\ngrounds. An inclination for the country is a venial fault. He has more\\nof Cowper than of Johnson in him,--fonder of tame hares and blank verse\\nthan of the full tide of human existence at Charing Cross.\\n\\nOh! I have more of such sweet flattery from Miss Sharp. She is an\\nexcellent kind friend. I am read and admired in Ireland too. There is a\\nMrs. Fletcher, the wife of a judge, an old lady, and very good and very\\nclever, who is all curiosity to know about me,--what I am like, and so\\nforth. I am not known to her by name, however. This comes through Mrs.\\nCarrick, not through Mrs. Gore. You are quite out there.\\n\\nI do not despair of having my picture in the Exhibition at last,--all\\nwhite and red, with my head on one side; or perhaps I may marry young\\nMr. D\\'Arblay. I suppose in the mean time I shall owe dear Henry a great\\ndeal of money for printing, etc.\\n\\nI hope Mrs. Fletcher will indulge herself with S. and S. If I am to stay\\nin H. S., and if you should be writing home soon, I wish you would be so\\ngood as to give a hint of it, for I am not likely to write there again\\nthese ten days, having written yesterday.\\n\\nFanny has set her heart upon its being a Mr. Brett who is going to marry\\na Miss Dora Best, of this country. I dare say Henry has no objection.\\nPray, where did the boys sleep?\\n\\nThe Deedes come here on Monday to stay till Friday, so that we shall end\\nwith a flourish the last canto. They bring Isabella and one of the\\ngrown-ups, and will come in for a Canty. ball on Thursday. I shall be\\nglad to see them. Mrs. Deedes and I must talk rationally together, I\\nsuppose.\\n\\nEdward does not write to Henry, because of my writing so often. God\\nbless you. I shall be so glad to see you again, and I wish you many\\nhappy returns of this day. Poor Lord Howard! How he does cry about it!\\n\\n                                      Yours very truly,        J. A.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN,\\n    10 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London.\\n\\nFOOTNOTE:\\n\\n[27] I cannot pass this paragraph over without remarking that it is\\nhardly possible to imagine anything neater or prettier than Jane\\'s own\\nhand.

       "  'text': 'GODMERSHAM PARK, Saturday (Nov. 6).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--Having half an hour before breakfast (very snug,\\nin my own room, lovely morning, excellent fire--fancy me!) I will give\\nyou some account of the last two days. And yet, what is there to be\\ntold? I shall get foolishly minute unless I cut the matter short.\\n\\nWe met only the Bretons at Chilham Castle, besides a Mr. and Mrs.\\nOsborne and a Miss Lee staying in the house, and were only fourteen\\naltogether. My brother and Fanny thought it the pleasantest party they\\nhad ever known there, and I was very well entertained by bits and\\nscraps. I had long wanted to see Dr. Breton, and his wife amuses me very\\nmuch with her affected refinement and elegance. Miss Lee I found very\\nconversable; she admires Crabbe as she ought. She is at an age of\\nreason, ten years older than myself at least. She was at the famous ball\\nat Chilham Castle, so of course you remember her.\\n\\nBy the by, as I must leave off being young, I find many _douceurs_ in\\nbeing a sort of _chaperon_, for I am put on the sofa near the fire, and\\ncan drink as much wine as I like. We had music in the evening: Fanny and\\nMiss Wildman played, and Mr. James Wildman sat close by and listened, or\\npretended to listen.\\n\\nYesterday was a day of dissipation all through: first came Sir Brook to\\ndissipate us before breakfast; then there was a call from Mr. Sherer,\\nthen a regular morning visit from Lady Honeywood in her way home from\\nEastwell; then Sir Brook and Edward set off; then we dined (five in\\nnumber) at half-past four; then we had coffee; and at six Miss Clewes,\\nFanny, and I drove away. We had a beautiful night for our frisks. We\\nwere earlier than we need have been, but after a time Lady B. and her\\ntwo companions appeared,--we had kept places for them; and there we sat,\\nall six in a row, under a side wall, I between Lucy Foote and Miss\\nClewes.\\n\\nLady B. was much what I expected; I could not determine whether she was\\nrather handsome or very plain. I liked her for being in a hurry to have\\nthe concert over and get away, and for getting away at last with a great\\ndeal of decision and promptness, not waiting to compliment and dawdle\\nand fuss about seeing dear Fanny, who was half the evening in another\\npart of the room with her friends the Plumptres. I am growing too\\nminute, so I will go to breakfast.\\n\\nWhen the concert was over, Mrs. Harrison and I found each other out, and\\nhad a very comfortable little complimentary friendly chat. She is a\\nsweet woman,--still quite a sweet woman in herself, and so like her\\nsister! I could almost have thought I was speaking to Mrs. Lefroy. She\\nintroduced me to her daughter, whom I think pretty, but most dutifully\\ninferior to _la Mère Beauté_. The Faggs and the Hammonds were\\nthere,--Wm. Hammond the only young man of renown. Miss looked very\\nhandsome, but I prefer her little smiling flirting sister Julia.\\n\\nI was just introduced at last to Mary Plumptre, but I should hardly know\\nher again. She was delighted with me, however, good enthusiastic soul!\\nAnd Lady B. found me handsomer than she expected, so you see I am not so\\nvery bad as you might think for.\\n\\nIt was twelve before we reached home. We were all dog-tired, but pretty\\nwell to-day: Miss Clewes says she has not caught cold, and Fanny\\'s does\\nnot seem worse. I was so tired that I began to wonder how I should get\\nthrough the ball next Thursday; but there will be so much more variety\\nthen in walking about, and probably so much less heat, that perhaps I\\nmay not feel it more. My china crape is still kept for the ball. Enough\\nof the concert.\\n\\nI had a letter from Mary yesterday. They travelled down to Cheltenham\\nlast Monday very safely, and are certainly to be there a month. Bath is\\nstill Bath. The H. Bridges must quit them early next week, and Louisa\\nseems not quite to despair of their all moving together, but to those\\nwho see at a distance there appears no chance of it. Dr. Parry does not\\nwant to keep Lady B. at Bath when she can once move. That is lucky. You\\nwill see poor Mr. Evelyn\\'s death.\\n\\nSince I wrote last, my 2nd edit. has stared me in the face. Mary tells\\nme that Eliza means to buy it. I wish she may. It can hardly depend upon\\nany more Fyfield Estates. I cannot help hoping that many will feel\\nthemselves obliged to buy it. I shall not mind imagining it a\\ndisagreeable duty to them, so as they do it. Mary heard before she left\\nhome that it was very much admired at Cheltenham, and that it was given\\nto Miss Hamilton. It is pleasant to have such a respectable writer\\nnamed. I cannot tire you, I am sure, on this subject, or I would\\napologize.\\n\\nWhat weather, and what news! We have enough to do to admire them both. I\\nhope you derive your full share of enjoyment from each.\\n\\nI have extended my lights and increased my acquaintance a good deal\\nwithin these two days. Lady Honeywood you know; I did not sit near\\nenough to be a perfect judge, but I thought her extremely pretty, and\\nher manners have all the recommendations of ease and good-humor and\\nunaffectedness; and going about with four horses and nicely dressed\\nherself, she is altogether a perfect sort of woman.\\n\\nOh, and I saw Mr. Gipps last night,--the useful Mr. Gipps, whose\\nattentions came in as acceptably to us in handing us to the carriage,\\nfor want of a better man, as they did to Emma Plumptre. I thought him\\nrather a good-looking little man.\\n\\nI long for your letter to-morrow, particularly that I may know my fate\\nas to London. My first wish is that Henry should really choose what he\\nlikes best; I shall certainly not be sorry if he does not want me.\\nMorning church to-morrow; I shall come back with impatient feelings.\\n\\nThe Sherers are gone, but the Pagets are not come: we shall therefore\\nhave Mr. S. again. Mr. Paget acts like an unsteady man. Dr. Hant,\\nhowever, gives him a very good character; what is wrong is to be imputed\\nto the lady. I dare say the house likes female government.\\n\\nI have a nice long black and red letter from Charles, but not\\ncommunicating much that I did not know.\\n\\nThere is some chance of a good ball next week, as far as females go.\\nLady Bridges may perhaps be there with some Knatchbulls. Mrs. Harrison\\nperhaps, with Miss Oxenden and the Miss Papillons; and if Mrs. Harrison,\\nthen Lady Fagg will come.\\n\\nThe shades of evening are descending, and I resume my interesting\\nnarrative. Sir Brook and my brother came back about four, and Sir Brook\\nalmost immediately set forward again to Goodnestone. We are to have\\nEdwd. B. to-morrow, to pay us another Sunday\\'s visit,--the last, for\\nmore reasons than one; they all come home on the same day that we go.\\nThe Deedes do not come till Tuesday; Sophia is to be the comer. She is a\\ndisputable beauty that I want much to see. Lady Eliz. Hatton and\\nAnnamaria called here this morning. Yes, they called; but I do not think\\nI can say anything more about them. They came, and they sat, and they\\nwent.\\n\\n_Sunday._--Dearest Henry! What a turn he has for being ill, and what a\\nthing bile is! This attack has probably been brought on in part by his\\nprevious confinement and anxiety; but, however it came, I hope it is\\ngoing fast, and that you will be able to send a very good account of him\\non Tuesday. As I hear on Wednesday, of course I shall not expect to hear\\nagain on Friday. Perhaps a letter to Wrotham would not have an ill\\neffect.\\n\\nWe are to be off on Saturday before the post comes in, as Edward takes\\nhis own horses all the way. He talks of nine o\\'clock. We shall bait at\\nLenham.\\n\\nExcellent sweetness of you to send me such a nice long letter; it made\\nits appearance, with one from my mother, soon after I and my impatient\\nfeelings walked in. How glad I am that I did what I did! I was only\\nafraid that you might think the offer superfluous, but you have set my\\nheart at ease. Tell Henry that I will stay with him, let it be ever so\\ndisagreeable to him.\\n\\nOh, dear me! I have not time on paper for half that I want to say. There\\nhave been two letters from Oxford,--one from George yesterday. They got\\nthere very safely,--Edwd. two hours behind the coach, having lost his\\nway in leaving London. George writes cheerfully and quietly; hopes to\\nhave Utterson\\'s rooms soon; went to lecture on Wednesday, states some of\\nhis expenses, and concludes with saying, \"I am afraid I shall be poor.\"\\nI am glad he thinks about it so soon. I believe there is no private\\ntutor yet chosen, but my brother is to hear from Edwd. on the subject\\nshortly.\\n\\nYou, and Mrs. H., and Catherine, and Alethea going about together in\\nHenry\\'s carriage seeing sights--I am not used to the idea of it yet. All\\nthat you are to see of Streatham, seen already! Your Streatham and my\\nBookham may go hang. The prospect of being taken down to Chawton by\\nHenry perfects the plan to me. I was in hopes of your seeing some\\nilluminations, and you have seen them. \"I thought you would come, and\\nyou did come.\" I am sorry he is not to come from the Baltic sooner. Poor\\nMary!\\n\\nMy brother has a letter from Louisa to-day of an unwelcome nature; they\\nare to spend the winter at Bath. It was just decided on. Dr. Parry\\nwished it, not from thinking the water necessary to Lady B., but that he\\nmight be better able to judge how far his treatment of her, which is\\ntotally different from anything she had been used to, is right; and I\\nsuppose he will not mind having a few more of her Ladyship\\'s guineas.\\nHis system is a lowering one. He took twelve ounces of blood from her\\nwhen the gout appeared, and forbids wine, etc. Hitherto the plan agrees\\nwith her. She is very well satisfied to stay, but it is a sore\\ndisappointment to Louisa and Fanny.\\n\\nThe H. Bridges leave them on Tuesday, and they mean to move into a\\nsmaller house; you may guess how Edward feels. There can be no doubt of\\nhis going to Bath now; I should not wonder if he brought Fanny Cage back\\nwith him.\\n\\nYou shall hear from me once more, some day or other.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,      J.

He took to Lady B. and Mrs. N.[29] most\\nkindly, and gives great praise to the drawing of the characters. He\\nunderstands them all, likes Fanny, and, I think, foresees how it will\\nall be. I finished the \"Heroine\" last night, and was very much amused by\\nit. I wonder James did not like it better. It diverted me exceedingly.\\nWe went to bed at ten. I was very tired, but slept to a miracle, and am\\nlovely to-day, and at present Henry seems to have no complaint. We left\\nCobham at half-past eight, stopped to bait and breakfast at Kingston,\\nand were in this house considerably before two.

I watched for veils as we drove through the\\nstreets, and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads. And\\nnow, how do you all do?--you in particular, after the worry of yesterday\\nand the day before. I hope Martha had a pleasant visit again, and that\\nyou and my mother could eat your beef-pudding. Depend upon my thinking\\nof the chimney-sweeper as soon as I wake to-morrow.

Mrs. Perigord has just been\\nhere. She tells me that we owe her master for the silk-dyeing. My poor\\nold muslin has never been dyed yet. It has been promised to be done\\nseveral times. What wicked people dyers are! They begin with dipping\\ntheir own souls in scarlet sin. It is evening. We have drank tea, and I\\nhave torn through the third vol. of the \"Heroine.\" I do not think it\\nfalls off. It is a delightful burlesque, particularly on the Radcliffe\\nstyle. Henry is going on with \"Mansfield Park.\" He admires H. Crawford:\\nI mean properly, as a clever, pleasant man. I tell you all the good I\\ncan, as I know how much you will enjoy it. We hear that Mr. Kean is more\\nadmired than ever. There are no good places to be got in Drury Lane for\\nthe next fortnight, but Henry means to secure some for Saturday\\nfortnight, when you are reckoned upon. Give my love to little Cass.

We all five walked together\\ninto the kitchen garden and along the Gosport road, and they drank tea\\nwith us.\\n\\nYou will be glad to hear that G. Turner has another situation, something\\nin the cow line, near Rumsey, and he wishes to move immediately, which\\nis not likely to be inconvenient to anybody.\\n\\nThe new nurseryman at Alton comes this morning to value the crops in the\\ngarden.\\n\\nThe only letter to-day is from Mrs. Cooke to me. They do not leave home\\ntill July, and want me to come to them, according to my promise. And,\\nafter considering everything, I have resolved on going. My companions\\npromote it. I will not go, however, till after Edward is gone, that he\\nmay feel he has a somebody to give memorandums to, to the last. I must\\ngive up all help from his carriage, of course. And, at any rate, it must\\nbe such an excess of expense that I have quite made up my mind to it,\\nand do not mean to care.\\n\\nI have been thinking of Triggs and the chair, you may be sure, but I\\nknow it will end in posting. They will meet me at Guildford.\\n\\nIn addition to their standing claims on me they admire \"Mansfield Park\"\\nexceedingly. Mr. Cooke says \"it is the most sensible novel he ever\\nread,\" and the manner in which I treat the clergy delights them very\\nmuch. Altogether, I must go, and I want you to join me there when your\\nvisit in Henrietta St. is over. Put this into your capacious head.\\n\\nTake care of yourself, and do not be trampled to death in running after\\nthe Emperor.

We were late in London,\\nfrom being a great load, and from changing coaches at Farnham; it was\\nnearly four, I believe, when we reached Sloane Street. Henry himself met\\nme, and as soon as my trunk and basket could be routed out from all the\\nother trunks and baskets in the world, we were on our way to Hans Place\\nin the luxury of a nice, large, cool, dirty hackney coach.\\n\\nThere were four in the kitchen part of Yalden, and I was told fifteen at\\ntop, among them Percy Benn. We met in the same room at Egham, but poor\\nPercy was not in his usual spirits. He would be more chatty, I dare say,\\nin his way from Woolwich. We took up a young Gibson at Holybourn, and,\\nin short, everybody either did come up by Yalden yesterday, or wanted to\\ncome up. It put me in mind of my own coach between Edinburgh and\\nStirling.\\n\\nHenry is very well, and has given me an account of the Canterbury races,\\nwhich seem to have been as pleasant as one could wish. Everything went\\nwell. Fanny had good partners, Mr. ---- was her second on Thursday, but\\nhe did not dance with her any more.\\n\\nThis will content you for the present. I must just add, however, that\\nthere were no Lady Charlottes, they were gone off to Kirby, and that\\nMary Oxenden, instead of dying, is going to marry Wm. Hammond.\\n\\nNo James and Edward yet. Our evening yesterday was perfectly quiet; we\\nonly talked a little to Mr. Tilson across the intermediate gardens; she\\nwas gone out airing with Miss Burdett. It is a delightful place,--more\\nthan answers my expectation. Having got rid of my unreasonable ideas, I\\nfind more space and comfort in the rooms than I had supposed, and the\\ngarden is quite a love. I am in the front attic, which is the bedchamber\\nto be preferred.\\n\\nHenry wants you to see it all, and asked whether you would return with\\nhim from Hampshire; I encouraged him to think you would. He breakfasts\\nhere early, and then rides to Henrietta St. If it continues fine, John\\nis to drive me there by and by, and we shall take an airing together;\\nand I do not mean to take any other exercise, for I feel a little tired\\nafter my long jumble. I live in his room downstairs; it is particularly\\npleasant from opening upon the garden. I go and refresh myself every now\\nand then, and then come back to solitary coolness. There is one\\nmaidservant only, a very creditable, clean-looking young woman. Richard\\nremains for the present.\\n\\n_Wednesday morning._--My brother and Edwd. arrived last night. They\\ncould not get places the day before. Their business is about teeth and\\nwigs, and they are going after breakfast to Scarman\\'s and Tavistock St.,\\nand they are to return to go with me afterwards in the barouche. I hope\\nto do some of my errands to-day.\\n\\nI got the willow yesterday, as Henry was not quite ready when I reached\\nHena. St. I saw Mr. Hampson there for a moment. He dines here to-morrow,\\nand proposed bringing his son; so I must submit to seeing George\\nHampson, though I had hoped to go through life without it. It was one of\\nmy vanities, like your not reading \"Patronage.\"\\n\\nAfter leaving H. St. we drove to Mrs. Latouche\\'s; they are always at\\nhome, and they are to dine here on Friday. We could do no more, as it\\nbegan to rain.\\n\\nWe dine at half-past four to-day, that our visitors may go to the play,\\nand Henry and I are to spend the evening with the Tilsons, to meet Miss\\nBurnett, who leaves town to-morrow. Mrs. T. called on me yesterday.\\n\\nIs not this all that can have happened or been arranged? Not quite.\\nHenry wants me to see more of his Hanwell favorite, and has written to\\ninvite her to spend a day or two here with me. His scheme is to fetch\\nher on Saturday. I am more and more convinced that he will marry again\\nsoon, and like the idea of her better than of anybody else at hand.\\n\\nNow I have breakfasted and have the room to myself again. It is likely\\nto be a fine day. How do you all do?\\n\\nHenry talks of being at Chawton about the 1st of Sept. He has once\\nmentioned a scheme which I should rather like,--calling on the Birches\\nand the Crutchleys in our way. It may never come to anything, but I must\\nprovide for the possibility by troubling you to send up my silk pelisse\\nby Collier on Saturday. I feel it would be necessary on such an\\noccasion; and be so good as to put up a clean dressing-gown which will\\ncome from the wash on Friday. You need not direct it to be left\\nanywhere. It may take its chance.\\n\\nWe are to call for Henry between three and four, and I must finish this\\nand carry it with me, as he is not always there in the morning before\\nthe parcel is made up. And before I set off, I must return Mrs. Tilson\\'s\\nvisit. I hear nothing of the Hoblyns, and abstain from all inquiry.\\n\\nI hope Mary Jane and Frank\\'s gardens go on well. Give my love to them\\nall--Nunna Hat\\'s love to George. A great many people wanted to run up in\\nthe Poach as well as me. The wheat looked very well all the way, and\\nJames says the same of _his_ road.\\n\\nThe same good account of Mrs. C.\\'s health continues, and her\\ncircumstances mend. She gets farther and farther from poverty. What a\\ncomfort! Good-by to you.\\n\\n                      Yours very truly and affectionately,\\n                                                        JANE.\\n\\nAll well at Steventon.

I read it aloud, and we are\\nall very much amused, and like the work quite as well as ever. I depend\\non getting through another book before dinner, but there is really a\\ngood deal of respectable reading in your forty-eight pages. I have no\\ndoubt six would make a very good-sized volume. You must have been quite\\npleased to have accomplished so much. I like Lord Portman and his\\nbrother very much. I am only afraid that Lord P.\\'s good nature will make\\nmost people like him better than he deserves. The whole family are very\\ngood; and Lady Anne, who was your great dread, you have succeeded\\nparticularly well with. Bell Griffin is just what she should be. My\\ncorrections have not been more important than before; here and there we\\nhave thought the sense could be expressed in fewer words, and I have\\nscratched out Sir Thos. from walking with the others to the stables,\\netc. the very day after breaking his arm; for though I find your papa\\ndid walk out immediately after his arm was set, I think it can be so\\nlittle usual as to appear unnatural in a book. Lynn will not do. Lynn is\\ntowards forty miles from Dawlish and would not be talked of there. I\\nhave put Starcross instead. If you prefer Easton, that must be always\\nsafe.\\n\\nI have also scratched out the introduction between Lord Portman and his\\nbrother and Mr. Griffin. A country surgeon (don\\'t tell Mr. C. Lyford)\\nwould not be introduced to men of their rank; and when Mr. P. is first\\nbrought in, he would not be introduced as the Honorable. That\\ndistinction is never mentioned at such times; at least, I believe not.\\nNow we have finished the second book, or rather the fifth. I do think\\nyou had better omit Lady Helena\\'s postscript. To those that are\\nacquainted with \"Pride and Prejudice\" it will seem an imitation. And\\nyour Aunt C. and I both recommend your making a little alteration in the\\nlast scene between Devereux F. and Lady Clanmurray and her daughter. We\\nthink they press him too much, more than sensible or well-bred women\\nwould do; Lady C., at least, should have discretion enough to be sooner\\nsatisfied with his determination of not going with them. I am very much\\npleased with Egerton as yet. I did not expect to like him, but I do, and\\nSusan is a very nice little animated creature; but St. Julian is the\\ndelight of our lives. He is quite interesting. The whole of his\\nbreak-off with Lady Helena is very well done. Yes; Russell Square is a\\nvery proper distance from Berkeley Square. We are reading the last book.\\nThey must be two days going from Dawlish to Bath. They are nearly one\\nhundred miles apart.\\n\\n_Thursday._--We finished it last night after our return from drinking\\ntea at the Great House. The last chapter does not please us quite so\\nwell; we do not thoroughly like the play, perhaps from having had too\\nmuch of plays in that way lately (_vide_ \"Mansfield Park\"), and we think\\nyou had better not leave England. Let the Portmans go to Ireland; but as\\nyou know nothing of the manners there, you had better not go with them.\\nYou will be in danger of giving false representations. Stick to Bath and\\nthe Foresters. There you will be quite at home.\\n\\nYour Aunt C. does not like desultory novels, and is rather afraid yours\\nwill be too much so, that there will be too frequently a change from one\\nset of people to another, and that circumstances will be introduced of\\napparent consequence which will lead to nothing. It will not be so great\\nan objection to me if it does. I allow much more latitude than she does,\\nand think Nature and spirit cover many sins of a wandering story, and\\npeople in general do not care so much about it for your comfort.\\n\\nI should like to have had more of Devereux. I do not feel enough\\nacquainted with him. You were afraid of meddling with him, I dare say. I\\nlike your sketch of Lord Clanmurray, and your picture of the two young\\ngirls\\' enjoyment is very good. I have not noticed St. Julian\\'s serious\\nconversation with Cecilia, but I like it exceedingly.

       "  'text': 'CHAWTON, Sept. 9.\\n\\nMY DEAR ANNA,--We have been very much amused by your three books, but I\\nhave a good many criticisms to make, more than you will like. We are not\\nsatisfied with Mrs. Forester settling herself as tenant and near\\nneighbor to such a man as Sir Thomas, without having some other\\ninducement to go there. She ought to have some friend living thereabouts\\nto tempt her. A woman going with two girls just growing up into a\\nneighborhood where she knows nobody but one man of not very good\\ncharacter, is an awkwardness which so prudent a woman as Mrs. F. would\\nnot be likely to fall into. Remember she is very prudent. You must not\\nlet her act inconsistently. Give her a friend, and let that friend be\\ninvited by Sir Thomas H. to meet her, and we shall have no objection to\\nher dining at the Priory as she does; but otherwise a woman in her\\nsituation would hardly go there before she had been visited by other\\nfamilies. I like the scene itself, the Miss Leslie, Lady Anne, and the\\nmusic very much. Leslie is a noble name. Sir Thomas H. you always do\\nvery well. I have only taken the liberty of expunging one phrase of his\\nwhich would not be allowable,--\"Bless my heart!\" It is too familiar and\\ninelegant. Your grandmother is more disturbed at Mrs. Forester\\'s not\\nreturning the Egertons\\' visit sooner than by anything else. They ought\\nto have called at the Parsonage before Sunday. You describe a sweet\\nplace, but your descriptions are often more minute than will be liked.\\nYou give too many particulars of right hand and left. Mrs. Forester is\\nnot careful enough of Susan\\'s health. Susan ought not to be walking out\\nso soon after heavy rains, taking long walks in the dirt. An anxious\\nmother would not suffer it. I like your Susan very much; she is a sweet\\ncreature, her playfulness of fancy is very delightful. I like her as she\\nis now exceedingly, but I am not quite so well satisfied with her\\nbehavior to George R. At first she seems all over attachment and\\nfeeling, and afterwards to have none at all; she is so extremely\\nconfused at the ball, and so well satisfied apparently with Mr. Morgan.\\nShe seems to have changed her character.\\n\\nYou are now collecting your people delightfully, getting them exactly\\ninto such a spot as is the delight of my life. Three or four families in\\na country village is the very thing to work on, and I hope you will do a\\ngreat deal more, and make full use of them while they are so very\\nfavorably arranged.\\n\\nYou are but now coming to the heart and beauty of your story. Until the\\nheroine grows up the fun must be imperfect, but I expect a great deal of\\nentertainment from the next three or four books, and I hope you will not\\nresent these remarks by sending me no more. We like the Egertons very\\nwell. We see no blue pantaloons or cocks or hens. There is nothing to\\nenchant one certainly in Mr. L. L., but we make no objection to him, and\\nhis inclination to like Susan is pleasing. The sister is a good\\ncontrast, but the name of Rachel is as much as I can bear. They are not\\nso much like the Papillons as I expected. Your last chapter is very\\nentertaining, the conversation on genius, etc.; Mr. St. Julian and Susan\\nboth talk in character, and very well. In some former parts Cecilia is\\nperhaps a little too solemn and good, but upon the whole her disposition\\nis very well opposed to Susan\\'s, her want of imagination is very\\nnatural. I wish you could make Mrs. Forester talk more; but she must be\\ndifficult to manage and make entertaining, because there is so much good\\nsense and propriety about her that nothing can be made very broad. Her\\neconomy and her ambition must not be staring. The papers left by Mrs.\\nFisher are very good. Of course one guesses something. I hope when you\\nhave written a great deal more, you will be equal to scratching out some\\nof the past. The scene with Mrs. Mellish I should condemn; it is prosy\\nand nothing to the purpose, and indeed the more you can find in your\\nheart to curtail between Dawlish and Newton Priors, the better I think\\nit will be,--one does not care for girls until they are grown up. Your\\nAunt C. quite understands the exquisiteness of that name,--Newton Priors\\nis really a nonpareil. Milton would have given his eyes to have thought\\nof it. Is not the cottage taken from Tollard Royal?\\n\\n[Thus far the letter was written on the 9th, but before it was finished\\nnews arrived at Chawton of the death of Mrs. Charles Austen. She died in\\nher confinement, and the baby died also. She left three little\\ngirls,--Cassie, Harriet, and Fanny.

I kept it that your grandmamma may hear it, for it has not\\nbeen possible yet to have any public reading. I have read it to your\\nAunt Cassandra, however, in our own room at night, while we undressed,\\nand with a great deal of pleasure. We like the first chapter extremely,\\nwith only a little doubt whether Lady Helena is not almost too foolish.\\nThe matrimonial dialogue is very good certainly. I like Susan as well as\\never, and begin now not to care at all about Cecilia; she may stay at\\nEaston Court as long as she likes. Henry Mellish will be, I am afraid,\\ntoo much in the common novel style,--a handsome, amiable,\\nunexceptionable young man (such as do not much abound in real life),\\ndesperately in love and all in vain. But I have no business to judge him\\nso early Jane Egerton is a very natural, comprehensible girl, and the\\nwhole of her acquaintance with Susan and Susan\\'s letter to Cecilia are\\nvery pleasing and quite in character. But Miss Egerton does not entirely\\nsatisfy us. She is too formal and solemn, we think, in her advice to her\\nbrother not to fall in love; and it is hardly like a sensible woman,--it\\nis putting it into his head. We should like a few hints from her better.\\nWe feel really obliged to you for introducing a Lady Kenrick; it will\\nremove the greatest fault in the work, and I give you credit for\\nconsiderable forbearance as an author in adopting so much of our\\nopinion. I expect high fun about Mrs. Fisher and Sir Thomas. You have\\nbeen perfectly right in telling Ben. Lefroy of your work, and I am very\\nglad to hear how much he likes it. His encouragement and approbation\\nmust be \"quite beyond everything.\"[33] I do not at all wonder at his not\\nexpecting to like anybody so well as Cecilia at first, but I shall be\\nsurprised if he does not become a Susanite in time. Devereux Forester\\'s\\nbeing ruined by his vanity is extremely good, but I wish you would not\\nlet him plunge into a \"vortex of dissipation.\" I do not object to the\\nthing, but I cannot bear the expression; it is such thorough novel\\nslang, and so old that I dare say Adam met with it in the first novel\\nhe opened. Indeed, I did very much like to know Ben\\'s opinion. I hope he\\nwill continue to be pleased with it, and I think he must, but I cannot\\nflatter him with there being much incident. We have no great right to\\nwonder at his not valuing the name of Progillian. That is a source of\\ndelight which even he can hardly be quite competent to.\\n\\nWalter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. It\\nis not fair. He has fame and profit enough as a poet, and should not be\\ntaking the bread out of the mouths of other people.\\n\\nI do not like him, and do not mean to like \"Waverley\" if I can help it,\\nbut fear I must.\\n\\nI am quite determined, however, not to be pleased with Mrs. West\\'s\\n\"Alicia De Lacy,\" should I ever meet with it, which I hope I shall not.\\nI think I can be stout against anything written by Mrs. West. I have\\nmade up my mind to like no novels really but Miss Edgeworth\\'s, yours,\\nand my own.\\n\\nWhat can you do with Egerton to increase the interest for him? I wish\\nyou could contrive something, some family occurrence to bring out his\\ngood qualities more. Some distress among brothers and sisters to relieve\\nby the sale of his curacy! Something to carry him mysteriously away, and\\nthen be heard of at York or Edinburgh in an old greatcoat. I would not\\nseriously recommend anything improbable, but if you could invent\\nsomething spirited for him, it would have a good effect. He might lend\\nall his money to Captain Morris, but then he would be a great fool if he\\ndid. Cannot the Morrises quarrel and he reconcile them? Excuse the\\nliberty I take in these suggestions.\\n\\nYour Aunt Frank\\'s nursemaid has just given her warning, but whether she\\nis worth your having, or would take your place, I know not. She was Mrs.\\nWebb\\'s maid before she went to the Great House. She leaves your aunt\\nbecause she cannot agree with the other servants. She is in love with\\nthe man, and her head seems rather turned. He returns her affection, but\\nshe fancies every one else is wanting him and envying her. Her previous\\nservice must have fitted her for such a place as yours, and she is very\\nactive and cleanly. The Webbs are really gone! When I saw the wagons at\\nthe door, and thought of all the trouble they must have in moving, I\\nbegan to reproach myself for not having liked them better; but since the\\nwagons have disappeared my conscience has been closed again, and I am\\nexcessively glad they are gone.\\n\\nI am very fond of Sherlock\\'s sermons, and prefer them to almost any.\\n\\n                           Your affectionate aunt,        J.

I shall do very little more, I dare\\nsay, than say over again what you have said before.\\n\\nI was certainly a good deal surprised at first, as I had no suspicion of\\nany change in your feelings, and I have no scruple in saying that you\\ncannot be in love. My dear Fanny, I am ready to laugh at the idea, and\\nyet it is no laughing matter to have had you so mistaken as to your own\\nfeelings. And with all my heart I wish I had cautioned you on that point\\nwhen first you spoke to me; but though I did not think you then much in\\nlove, I did consider you as being attached in a degree quite\\nsufficiently for happiness, as I had no doubt it would increase with\\nopportunity, and from the time of our being in London together I thought\\nyou really very much in love. But you certainly are not at all--there is\\nno concealing it.\\n\\nWhat strange creatures we are! It seems as if your being secure of him\\nhad made you indifferent. There was a little disgust, I suspect, at the\\nraces, and I do not wonder at it. His expressions then would not do for\\none who had rather more acuteness, penetration, and taste, than love,\\nwhich was your case. And yet, after all, I am surprised that the change\\nin your feelings should be so great. He is just what he ever was, only\\nmore evidently and uniformly devoted to you. This is all the difference.\\nHow shall we account for it?\\n\\nMy dearest Fanny, I am writing what will not be of the smallest use to\\nyou. I am feeling differently every moment, and shall not be able to\\nsuggest a single thing that can assist your mind. I could lament in one\\nsentence and laugh in the next, but as to opinion or counsel I am sure\\nthat none will be extracted worth having from this letter.\\n\\nI read yours through the very evening I received it, getting away by\\nmyself. I could not bear to leave off when I had once begun. I was full\\nof curiosity and concern. Luckily your At. C. dined at the other house;\\ntherefore I had not to manoeuvre away from her, and as to anybody else,\\nI do not care.\\n\\nPoor dear Mr. A.! Oh, dear Fanny! your mistake has been one that\\nthousands of women fall into. He was the first young man who attached\\nhimself to you. That was the charm, and most powerful it is. Among the\\nmultitudes, however, that make the same mistake with yourself, there can\\nbe few indeed who have so little reason to regret it; his character and\\nhis attachment leave you nothing to be ashamed of.\\n\\nUpon the whole, what is to be done? You have no inclination for any\\nother person. His situation in life, family, friends, and, above all,\\nhis character, his uncommonly amiable mind, strict principles, just\\nnotions, good habits, all that you know so well how to value, all that\\nis really of the first importance,--everything of this nature pleads his\\ncause most strongly. You have no doubt of his having superior abilities,\\nhe has proved it at the University; he is, I dare say, such a scholar as\\nyour agreeable, idle brothers would ill bear a comparison with.\\n\\nOh, my dear Fanny! the more I write about him the warmer my feelings\\nbecome,--the more strongly I feel the sterling worth of such a young\\nman, and the desirableness of your growing in love with him again. I\\nrecommend this most thoroughly. There are such beings in the world,\\nperhaps one in a thousand, as the creature you and I should think\\nperfection, where grace and spirit are united to worth, where the\\nmanners are equal to the heart and understanding; but such a person may\\nnot come in your way, or, if he does, he may not be the eldest son of a\\nman of fortune, the near relation of your particular friend, and\\nbelonging to your own county.\\n\\nThink of all this, Fanny. Mr. A. has advantages which we do not often\\nmeet in one person. His only fault, indeed, seems modesty. If he were\\nless modest, he would be more agreeable, speak louder, and look\\nimpudenter; and is not it a fine character of which modesty is the only\\ndefect? I have no doubt he will get more lively and more like yourselves\\nas he is more with you; he will catch your ways if he belongs to you.\\nAnd as to there being any objection from his goodness, from the danger\\nof his becoming even evangelical, I cannot admit that. I am by no means\\nconvinced that we ought not all to be evangelicals, and am at least\\npersuaded that they who are so from reason and feeling must be happiest\\nand safest. Do not be frightened from the connection by your brothers\\nhaving most wit,--wisdom is better than wit, and in the long run will\\ncertainly have the laugh on her side; and don\\'t be frightened by the\\nidea of his acting more strictly up to the precepts of the New Testament\\nthan others.\\n\\nAnd now, my dear Fanny, having written so much on one side of the\\nquestion, I shall turn round and entreat you not to commit yourself\\nfarther, and not to think of accepting him unless you really do like\\nhim. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying\\nwithout affection; and if his deficiencies of manner, etc., etc.,\\nstrike you more than all his good qualities, if you continue to think\\nstrongly of them, give him up at once. Things are now in such a state\\nthat you must resolve upon one or the other,--either to allow him to go\\non as he has done, or whenever you are together behave with a coldness\\nwhich may convince him that he has been deceiving himself. I have no\\ndoubt of his suffering a good deal for a time,--a great deal when he\\nfeels that he must give you up; but it is no creed of mine, as you must\\nbe well aware, that such sort of disappointments kill anybody.\\n\\nYour sending the music was an admirable device, it made everything easy,\\nand I do not know how I could have accounted for the parcel otherwise;\\nfor though your dear papa most conscientiously hunted about till he\\nfound me alone in the dining-parlor, your Aunt C. had seen that he had a\\nparcel to deliver. As it was, however, I do not think anything was\\nsuspected.\\n\\nWe have heard nothing fresh from Anna. I trust she is very comfortable\\nin her new home. Her letters have been very sensible and satisfactory,\\nwith no parade of happiness, which I liked them the better for. I have\\noften known young married women write in a way I did not like in that\\nrespect.\\n\\nYou will be glad to hear that the first edition of M. P.[34] is all\\nsold. Your Uncle Henry is rather wanting me to come to town to settle\\nabout a second edition; but as I could not very conveniently leave home\\nnow, I have written him my will and pleasure and unless he still urges\\nit, shall not go. I am very greedy and want to make the most of it; but\\nas you are much above caring about money, I shall not plague you with\\nany particulars. The pleasures of vanity are more within your\\ncomprehension, and you will enter into mine at receiving the praise\\nwhich every now and then comes to me through some channel or other.\\n\\n_Saturday._--Mr. Palmer spent yesterday with us, and is gone off with\\nCassy this morning. We have been expecting Miss Lloyd the last two days,\\nand feel sure of her to-day. Mr. Knight and Mr. Edwd. Knight are to dine\\nwith us, and on Monday they are to dine with us again, accompanied by\\ntheir respectable host and hostess.\\n\\n_Sunday._--Your papa had given me messages to you; but they are\\nunnecessary, as he writes by this post to Aunt Louisa. We had a pleasant\\nparty yesterday; at least we found it so. It is delightful to see him so\\ncheerful and confident.

The name of Newton Priors is\\nreally invaluable; I never met with anything superior to it. It is\\ndelightful, and one could live on the name of Newton Priors for a\\ntwelvemonth.

I certainly could describe her bedroom and her drawers\\nand her closet better than he can, but I do not feel that I can stop to\\ndo it. I was rather sorry to hear that she is to have an instrument; it\\nseems throwing money away. They will wish the twenty-four guineas in the\\nshape of sheets and towels six months hence; and as to her playing, it\\nnever can be anything.\\n\\nHer purple pelisse rather surprised me. I thought we had known all\\nparaphernalia of that sort. I do not mean to blame her; it looked very\\nwell, and I dare say she wanted it. I suspect nothing worse than its\\nbeing got in secret, and not owned to anybody. I received a very kind\\nnote from her yesterday, to ask me to come again and stay a night with\\nthem. I cannot do it, but I was pleased to find that she had the power\\nof doing so right a thing. My going was to give them both pleasure very\\nproperly.\\n\\nI just saw Mr. Hayter at the play, and think his face would please me on\\nacquaintance. I was sorry he did not dine here. It seemed rather odd to\\nme to be in the theatre with nobody to watch for. I was quite composed\\nmyself, at leisure for all the agitated Isabella could raise.\\n\\nNow, my dearest Fanny, I will begin a subject which comes in very\\nnaturally. You frighten me out of my wits by your reference. Your\\naffection gives me the highest pleasure, but indeed you must not let\\nanything depend on my opinion; your own feelings, and none but your own,\\nshould determine such an important point. So far, however, as answering\\nyour question, I have no scruple. I am perfectly convinced that your\\npresent feelings, supposing that you were to marry now, would be\\nsufficient for his happiness; but when I think how very, very far it is\\nfrom a \"now,\" and take everything that may be into consideration, I dare\\nnot say, \"Determine to accept him;\" the risk is too great for you,\\nunless your own sentiments prompt it.\\n\\nYou will think me perverse, perhaps; in my last letter I was urging\\neverything in his favor, and now I am inclining the other way, but I\\ncannot help it; I am at present more impressed with the possible evil\\nthat may arise to you from engaging yourself to him--in word or\\nmind--than with anything else. When I consider how few young men you\\nhave yet seen much of, how capable you are (yes, I do still think you\\nvery capable) of being really in love, and how full of temptation the\\nnext six or seven years of your life will probably be (it is the very\\nperiod of life for the strongest attachments to be formed),--I cannot\\nwish you, with your present very cool feelings, to devote yourself in\\nhonor to him. It is very true that you never may attach another man his\\nequal altogether; but if that other man has the power of attaching you\\nmore, he will be in your eyes the most perfect.\\n\\nI shall be glad if you can revive past feelings, and from your unbiassed\\nself resolve to go on as you have done, but this I do not expect; and\\nwithout it I cannot wish you to be fettered. I should not be afraid of\\nyour marrying him; with all his worth you would soon love him enough for\\nthe happiness of both; but I should dread the continuance of this sort\\nof tacit engagement, with such an uncertainty as there is of when it may\\nbe completed. Years may pass before he is independent; you like him well\\nenough to marry, but not well enough to wait; the unpleasantness of\\nappearing fickle is certainly great; but if you think you want\\npunishment for past illusions, there it is, and nothing can be compared\\nto the misery of being bound without love,--bound to one, and preferring\\nanother; that is a punishment which you do not deserve.\\n\\nI know you did not meet, or rather will not meet, to-day, as he called\\nhere yesterday; and I am glad of it. It does not seem very likely, at\\nleast, that he should be in time for a dinner visit sixty miles off. We\\ndid not see him, only found his card when we came home at four. Your\\nUncle H. merely observed that he was a day after \"the fair.\" We asked\\nyour brother on Monday (when Mr. Hayter was talked of) why he did not\\ninvite him too; saying, \"I know he is in town, for I met him the other\\nday in Bond St.\" Edward answered that he did not know where he was to be\\nfound. \"Don\\'t you know his chambers?\" \"No.\"\\n\\nI shall be most glad to hear from you again, my dearest Fanny, but it\\nmust not be later than Saturday, as we shall be off on Monday long\\nbefore the letters are delivered; and write something that may do to be\\nread or told. I am to take the Miss Moores back on Saturday, and when I\\nreturn I shall hope to find your pleasant little flowing scrawl on the\\ntable. It will be a relief to me after playing at ma\\'ams, for though I\\nlike Miss H. M. as much as one can at my time of life after a day\\'s\\nacquaintance, it is uphill work to be talking to those whom one knows so\\nlittle.\\n\\nOnly one comes back with me to-morrow, probably Miss Eliza, and I rather\\ndread it. We shall not have two ideas in common. She is young, pretty,\\nchattering, and thinking chiefly, I presume, of dress, company, and\\nadmiration. Mr. Sanford is to join us at dinner, which will be a\\ncomfort, and in the evening, while your uncle and Miss Eliza play chess,\\nhe shall tell me comical things and I will laugh at them, which will be\\na pleasure to both.\\n\\nI called in Keppel Street and saw them all, including dear Uncle\\nCharles, who is to come and dine with us quietly to-day. Little Harriot\\nsat in my lap, and seemed as gentle and affectionate as ever, and as\\npretty, except not being quite well. Fanny is a fine stout girl, talking\\nincessantly, with an interesting degree of lisp and indistinctness, and\\nvery likely may be the handsomest in time. Cassy did not show more\\npleasure in seeing me than her sisters, but I expected no better. She\\ndoes not shine in the tender feelings. She will never be a Miss O\\'Neil,\\nmore in the Mrs. Siddons line.\\n\\nThank you, but it is not settled yet whether I do hazard a second\\nedition. We are to see Egerton to-day, when it will probably be\\ndetermined. People are more ready to borrow and praise than to buy,\\nwhich I cannot wonder at; but though I like praise as well as anybody, I\\nlike what Edward calls \"Pewter\" too. I hope he continues careful of his\\neyes, and finds the good effect of it. I cannot suppose we differ in our\\nideas of the Christian religion. You have given an excellent description\\nof it.

We really\\ngrow so fond of Mr. Haden that I do not know what to expect. He and Mr.\\nTilson and Mr. Philips made up our circle of wits last night. Fanny\\nplayed, and he sat and listened and suggested improvements, till Richard\\ncame in to tell him that \"the doctor was waiting for him at Captn.\\nBlake\\'s;\" and then he was off with a speed that you can imagine. He\\nnever does appear in the least above his profession or out of humor\\nwith it, or I should think poor Captn. Blake, whoever he is, in a very\\nbad way.\\n\\nI must have misunderstood Henry when I told you that you were to hear\\nfrom him to-day. He read me what he wrote to Edward: part of it must\\nhave amused him, I am sure one part, alas! cannot be very amusing to\\nanybody. I wonder that with such business to worry him he can be getting\\nbetter; but he certainly does gain strength, and if you and Edwd. were\\nto see him now, I feel sure that you would think him improved since\\nMonday.\\n\\nHe was out yesterday; it was a fine sunshiny day here (in the country\\nperhaps you might have clouds and fogs. Dare I say so? I shall not\\ndeceive you, if I do, as to my estimation of the climate of London), and\\nhe ventured first on the balcony and then as far as the greenhouse. He\\ncaught no cold, and therefore has done more to-day, with great delight\\nand self-persuasion of improvement.\\n\\nHe has been to see Mrs. Tilson and the Malings. By the by, you may talk\\nto Mr. T. of his wife\\'s being better; I saw her yesterday, and was\\nsensible of her having gained ground in the last two days.\\n\\n_Evening._--We have had no Edward. Our circle is formed,--only Mr.\\nTilson and Mr. Haden. We are not so happy as we were. A message came\\nthis afternoon from Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, offering themselves to\\ndrink tea with us to-morrow, and, as it was accepted, here is an end of\\nour extreme felicity in our dinner guest. I am heartily sorry they are\\ncoming; it will be an evening spoilt to Fanny and me.\\n\\nAnother little disappointment: Mr. H. advises Henry\\'s not venturing with\\nus in the carriage to-morrow; if it were spring, he says, it would be a\\ndifferent thing. One would rather this had not been. He seems to think\\nhis going out to-day rather imprudent, though acknowledging at the same\\ntime that he is better than he was in the morning.\\n\\nFanny has had a letter full of commissions from Goodnestone; we shall be\\nbusy about them and her own matters, I dare say, from twelve to four.\\nNothing, I trust, will keep us from Keppel Street.\\n\\nThis day has brought a most friendly letter from Mr. Fowle, with a brace\\nof pheasants. I did not know before that Henry had written to him a few\\ndays ago to ask for them. We shall live upon pheasants,--no bad life!\\n\\nI send you five one-pound notes, for fear you should be distressed for\\nlittle money. Lizzy\\'s work is charmingly done; shall you put it to your\\nchintz? A sheet came in this moment; 1st and 3rd vols. are now at 144;\\n2nd at 48. I am sure you will like particulars. We are not to have the\\ntrouble of returning the sheets to Mr. Murray any longer; the printer\\'s\\nboys bring and carry.\\n\\nI hope Mary continues to get well fast, and I send my love to little\\nHerbert. You will tell me more of Martha\\'s plans, of course, when you\\nwrite again. Remember me most kindly to everybody, and Miss Benn\\nbesides.\\n\\n                            Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                   J. AUSTEN.\\n\\nI have been listening to dreadful insanity. It is Mr. Haden\\'s firm\\nbelief that a person not musical is fit for every sort of wickedness. I\\nventured to assert a little on the other side, but wished the cause in\\nabler hands.\\n\\n  Miss AUSTEN, Chawton.'},\n",

We got to Keppel St., however, which was all I cared\\nfor; and though we could stay only a quarter of an hour, Fanny\\'s calling\\ngave great pleasure, and her sensibility still greater, for she was very\\nmuch affected at the sight of the children.

From seven to eight the harp; at\\neight Mrs. L. and Miss E. arrived, and for the rest of the evening the\\ndrawing-room was thus arranged: on the sofa side the two ladies, Henry,\\nand myself making the best of it; on the opposite side Fanny and Mr.\\nHaden, in two chairs (I believe, at least, they had two chairs), talking\\ntogether uninterruptedly. Fancy the scene! And what is to be fancied\\nnext? Why, that Mr. H. dines here again to-morrow. To-day we are to have\\nMr. Barlow. Mr. H. is reading \"Mansfield Park\" for the first time, and\\nprefers it to P. and P.\\n\\nA hare and four rabbits from Gm. yesterday, so that we are stocked for\\nnearly a week.

I am glad you cannot wake early; I am sure\\nyou must have been under great arrears of rest.\\n\\nFanny and I have been to B.

This is only a silent project, you\\nknow, to be gladly given up if better things occur. Henry calls himself\\nstronger every day, and Mr. H. keeps on approving his pulse, which seems\\ngenerally better than ever, but still they will not let him be well.\\nPerhaps when Fanny is gone he will be allowed to recover faster.\\n\\nI am not disappointed: I never thought the little girl at Wyards very\\npretty, but she will have a fine complexion and curly hair, and pass for\\na beauty.

I had the pleasure of\\nhearing from Mr. T. on Wednesday night that Mr. Seymour thought there\\nwas not the least occasion for his absenting himself any longer.\\n\\nI had also the comfort of a few lines on Wednesday morning from Henry\\nhimself, just after your letter was gone, giving so good an account of\\nhis feelings as made me perfectly easy. He met with the utmost care and\\nattention at Hanwell, spent his two days there very quietly and\\npleasantly, and being certainly in no respect the worse for going, we\\nmay believe that he must be better, as he is quite sure of being\\nhimself. To make his return a complete gala, Mr. Haden was secured for\\ndinner. I need not say that our evening was agreeable.\\n\\nBut you seem to be under a mistake as to Mr. H. You call him an\\napothecary. He is no apothecary; he has never been an apothecary; there\\nis not an apothecary in this neighborhood,--the only inconvenience of\\nthe situation, perhaps,--but so it is; we have not a medical man within\\nreach. He is a Haden, nothing but a Haden, a sort of wonderful\\nnondescript creature on two legs, something between a man and an angel,\\nbut without the least spice of an apothecary. He is, perhaps, the only\\nperson not an apothecary hereabouts. He has never sung to us. He will\\nnot sing without a pianoforte accompaniment.\\n\\nMr. Meyers gives his three lessons a week, altering his days and his\\nhours, however, just as he chooses, never very punctual, and never\\ngiving good measure. I have not Fanny's fondness for masters, and Mr.\\nMeyers does not give me any longing after them. The truth is, I think,\\nthat they are all, at least music-masters, made of too much consequence,\\nand allowed to take too many liberties with their scholars' time.\\n\\nWe shall be delighted to see Edward on Monday, only sorry that you must\\nbe losing him. A turkey will be equally welcome with himself. He must\\nprepare for his own proper bedchamber here, as Henry moved down to the\\none below last week; he found the other cold.\\n\\nI am sorry my mother has been suffering, and am afraid this exquisite\\nweather is too good to agree with her. I enjoy it all over me, from top\\nto toe, from right to left, longitudinally, perpendicularly, diagonally;\\nand I cannot but selfishly hope we are to have it last till\\nChristmas,--nice, unwholesome, unseasonable, relaxing, close, muggy\\nweather.\\n\\nOh, thank you very much for your long letter; it did me a great deal of\\ngood. Henry accepts your offer of making his nine gallon of mead\\nthankfully. The mistake of the dogs rather vexed him for a moment, but\\nhe has not thought of it since. To-day he makes a third attempt at his\\nstrengthening plaister, and as I am sure he will now be getting out a\\ngreat deal, it is to be wished that he may be able to keep it on. He\\nsets off this morning by the Chelsea coach to sign bonds and visit\\nHenrietta St., and I have no doubt will be going every day to Henrietta\\nSt.\\n\\nFanny and I were very snug by ourselves as soon as we were satisfied\\nabout our invalid's being safe at Hanwell. By manoeuvring and good luck\\nwe foiled all the Malings' attempts upon us. Happily I caught a little\\ncold on Wednesday, the morning we were in town, which we made very\\nuseful, and we saw nobody but our precious[38] and Mr. Tilson.\\n\\nThis evening the Malings are allowed to drink tea with us. We are in\\nhopes--that is, we wish--Miss Palmer and the little girls may come this\\nmorning. You know, of course, that she could not come on Thursday, and\\nshe will not attempt to name any other day.\\n\\nGod bless you. Excuse the shortness of this, but I must finish it now,\\nthat I may save you 2_d._ Best love.\\n\\n                                  Yours affectionately,     J.

Such letters, such entertaining letters, as you have lately\\nsent! such a description of your queer little heart! such a lovely\\ndisplay of what imagination does! You are worth your weight in gold, or\\neven in the new silver coinage. I cannot express to you what I have felt\\nin reading your history of yourself,--how full of pity and concern, and\\nadmiration and amusement I have been! You are the paragon of all that is\\nsilly and sensible, commonplace and eccentric, sad and lively, provoking\\nand interesting. Who can keep pace with the fluctuations of your fancy,\\nthe capprizios of your taste, the contradictions of your feelings? You\\nare so odd, and all the time so perfectly natural!--so peculiar in\\nyourself, and yet so like everybody else!\\n\\nIt is very, very gratifying to me to know you so intimately. You can\\nhardly think what a pleasure it is to me to have such thorough pictures\\nof your heart. Oh, what a loss it will be when you are married! You are\\ntoo agreeable in your single state,--too agreeable as a niece. I shall\\nhate you when your delicious play of mind is all settled down into\\nconjugal and maternal affections.\\n\\nMr. B---- frightens me. He will have you. I see you at the altar. I have\\nsome faith in Mrs. C. Cage\\'s observation, and still more in Lizzy\\'s; and\\nbesides, I know it must be so. He must be wishing to attach you. It\\nwould be too stupid and too shameful in him to be otherwise; and all the\\nfamily are seeking your acquaintance.\\n\\nDo not imagine that I have any real objection; I have rather taken a\\nfancy to him than not, and I like the house for you. I only do not like\\nyou should marry anybody. And yet I do wish you to marry very much,\\nbecause I know you will never be happy till you are; but the loss of a\\nFanny Knight will be never made up to me. My \"affec. niece F. C. B----\"\\nwill be but a poor substitute. I do not like your being nervous, and so\\napt to cry,--it is a sign you are not quite well; but I hope Mr.\\nScud--as you always write his name (your Mr. Scuds amuse me very\\nmuch)--will do you good.\\n\\nWhat a comfort that Cassandra should be so recovered! It was more than\\nwe had expected. I can easily believe she was very patient and very\\ngood. I always loved Cassandra for her fine dark eyes and sweet temper.\\nI am almost entirely cured of my rheumatism,--just a little pain in my\\nknee now and then, to make me remember what it was, and keep on flannel.\\nAunt Cassandra nursed me so beautifully.\\n\\nI enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, it must be a great pleasure to you;\\nyou have not seen Fanny Cage in comfort so long. I hope she represents\\nand remonstrates and reasons with you properly. Why should you be living\\nin dread of his marrying somebody else? (Yet how natural!) You did not\\nchoose to have him yourself, why not allow him to take comfort where he\\ncan? In your conscience you know that he could not bear a companion with\\na more animated character. You cannot forget how you felt under the idea\\nof its having been possible that he might have dined in Hans Place.\\n\\nMy dearest Fanny, I cannot bear you should be unhappy about him. Think\\nof his principles; think of his father\\'s objection, of want of money,\\netc., etc. But I am doing no good; no, all that I urge against him will\\nrather make you take his part more,--sweet, perverse Fanny.\\n\\nAnd now I will tell you that we like your Henry to the utmost, to the\\nvery top of the glass, quite brimful. He is a very pleasing young man. I\\ndo not see how he could be mended. He does really bid fair to be\\neverything his father and sister could wish; and William I love very\\nmuch indeed, and so we do all; he is quite our own William. In short, we\\nare very comfortable together; that is, we can answer for ourselves.\\n\\nMrs. Deedes is as welcome as May to all our benevolence to her son; we\\nonly lamented that we could not do more, and that the 50_l._ note we\\nslipped into his hand at parting was necessarily the limit of our\\noffering. Good Mrs. Deedes! Scandal and gossip; yes, I dare say you are\\nwell stocked, but I am very fond of Mrs. ---- for reasons good. Thank\\nyou for mentioning her praise of \"Emma,\" etc.\\n\\nI have contributed the marking to Uncle H.\\'s shirts, and now they are a\\ncomplete memorial of the tender regard of many.\\n\\n_Friday._--I had no idea when I began this yesterday of sending it\\nbefore your brother went back, but I have written away my foolish\\nthoughts at such a rate that I will not keep them many hours longer to\\nstare me in the face.\\n\\nMuch obliged for the quadrilles, which I am grown to think pretty\\nenough, though of course they are very inferior to the cotillons of my\\nown day.\\n\\nBen and Anna walked here last Sunday to hear Uncle Henry, and she looked\\nso pretty, it was quite a pleasure to see her, so young and so blooming\\nand so innocent, as if she had never had a wicked thought in her life,\\nwhich yet one has some reason to suppose she must have had, if we\\nbelieve the doctrine of original sin. I hope Lizzy will have her play\\nvery kindly arranged for her. Henry is generally thought very\\ngood-looking, but not so handsome as Edward. I think I prefer his face.\\nWm. is in excellent looks, has a fine appetite, and seems perfectly\\nwell. You will have a great break up at Godmersham in the spring. You\\nmust feel their all going. It is very right, however! Poor Miss C.! I\\nshall pity her when she begins to understand herself.\\n\\nYour objection to the quadrilles delighted me exceedingly. Pretty well,\\nfor a lady irrecoverably attached to one person! Sweet Fanny, believe no\\nsuch thing of yourself, spread no such malicious slander upon your\\nunderstanding within the precincts of your imagination. Do not speak ill\\nof your sense merely for the gratification of your fancy; yours is sense\\nwhich deserves more honorable treatment.

Mrs. Philmore attended as chief\\nmourner, in bombazine, made very short, and flounced with crape.\\n\\n_Tuesday._--I have had various plans as to this letter, but at last I\\nhave determined that Uncle Henry shall forward it from London.

London has become a hateful place to him,\\nand he is always depressed by the idea of it. I hope he will be in time\\nfor your sick. I am sure he must do that part of his duty as excellently\\nas all the rest. He returned yesterday from Steventon, and was with us\\nby breakfast, bringing Edward with him, only that Edwd. stayed to\\nbreakfast at Wyards. We had a pleasant family day, for the Altons dined\\nwith us, the last visit of the kind probably which she will be able to\\npay us for many a month.\\n\\nI hope your own Henry is in France, and that you have heard from him;\\nthe passage once over, he will feel all happiness.

I went up Mounter's Lane and round by\\nwhere the new cottages are to be, and found the exercise and everything\\nvery pleasant; and I had the advantage of agreeable companions, as At.\\nCass. and Edward walked by my side.

       "  'text': 'CHAWTON, Sunday (Sept. 8, 1816).\\n\\nMY DEAREST CASSANDRA,--I have borne the arrival of your letter to-day\\nextremely well; anybody might have thought it was giving me pleasure. I\\nam very glad you find so much to be satisfied with at Cheltenham. While\\nthe waters agree, everything else is trifling.\\n\\nA letter arrived for you from Charles last Thursday. They are all safe\\nand pretty well in Keppel St., the children decidedly better for\\nBroadstairs; and he writes principally to ask when it will be convenient\\nto us to receive Miss P., the little girls, and himself. They would be\\nready to set off in ten days from the time of his writing, to pay their\\nvisits in Hampshire and Berkshire, and he would prefer coming to Chawton\\nfirst.\\n\\nI have answered him, and said that we hoped it might suit them to wait\\ntill the last week in Septr., as we could not ask them sooner, either on\\nyour account or the want of room. I mentioned the 23rd as the probable\\nday of your return. When you have once left Cheltenham, I shall grudge\\nevery half-day wasted on the road. If there were but a coach from\\nHungerford to Chawton! I have desired him to let me hear again soon.\\n\\nHe does not include a maid in the list to be accommodated; but if they\\nbring one, as I suppose they will, we shall have no bed in the house\\neven then for Charles himself,--let alone Henry. But what can we do?\\n\\nWe shall have the Gt. House quite at our command; it is to be cleared of\\nthe Papillons\\' servants in a day or two. They themselves have been\\nhurried off into Essex to take possession,--not of a large estate left\\nthem by an uncle, but to scrape together all they can, I suppose, of the\\neffects of a Mrs. Rawstorn, a rich old friend and cousin suddenly\\ndeceased, to whom they are joint executors. So there is a happy end of\\nthe Kentish Papillons coming here.\\n\\nNo morning service to-day, wherefore I am writing between twelve and one\\no\\'clock. Mr. Benn in the afternoon, and likewise more rain again, by the\\nlook and the sound of things. You left us in doubt of Mrs. Benn\\'s\\nsituation, but she has bespoke her nurse. . . . The F. A.\\'s dined with\\nus yesterday, and had fine weather both for coming and going home, which\\nhas hardly ever happened to them before. She is still unprovided with a\\nhousemaid.\\n\\nOur day at Alton was very pleasant, venison quite right, children well\\nbehaved, and Mr. and Mrs. Digweed taking kindly to our charades and\\nother games. I must also observe, for his mother\\'s satisfaction, that\\nEdward at my suggestion devoted himself very properly to the\\nentertainment of Miss S. Gibson. Nothing was wanting except Mr. Sweeney;\\nbut he, alas! had been ordered away to London the day before. We had a\\nbeautiful walk home by moonlight.\\n\\nThank you, my back has given me scarcely any pain for many days. I have\\nan idea that agitation does it as much harm as fatigue, and that I was\\nill at the time of your going from the very circumstance of your going.\\nI am nursing myself up now into as beautiful a state as I can, because I\\nhear that Dr. White means to call on me before he leaves the country.\\n\\n_Evening._--Frank and Mary and the children visited us this morning. Mr.\\nand Mrs. Gibson are to come on the 23rd, and there is too much reason to\\nfear they will stay above a week. Little George could tell me where you\\nwere gone to, as well as what you were to bring him, when I asked him\\nthe other day.\\n\\nSir Tho. Miller is dead. I treat you with a dead baronet in almost every\\nletter.\\n\\nSo you have C. Craven among you, as well as the Duke of Orleans and Mr.\\nPocock. But it mortifies me that you have not added one to the stock of\\ncommon acquaintance. Do pray meet with somebody belonging to yourself. I\\nam quite weary of your knowing nobody.\\n\\nMrs. Digweed parts with both Hannah and old cook: the former will not\\ngive up her lover, who is a man of bad character; the latter is guilty\\nonly of being unequal to anything.\\n\\nMiss Terry was to have spent this week with her sister, but as usual it\\nis put off. My amiable friend knows the value of her company. I have not\\nseen Anna since the day you left us; her father and brother visited her\\nmost days. Edward and Ben called here on Thursday. Edward was in his way\\nto Selborne. We found him very agreeable. He is come back from France,\\nthinking of the French as one could wish,--disappointed in everything.\\nHe did not go beyond Paris.\\n\\nI have a letter from Mrs. Perigord; she and her mother are in London\\nagain. She speaks of France as a scene of general poverty and misery: no\\nmoney, no trade, nothing to be got but by the innkeepers, and as to her\\nown present prospects she is not much less melancholy than before.\\n\\nI have also a letter from Miss Sharp, quite one of her letters; she has\\nbeen again obliged to exert herself more than ever, in a more\\ndistressing, more harassed state, and has met with another excellent old\\nphysician and his wife, with every virtue under heaven, who takes to her\\nand cures her from pure love and benevolence. Dr. and Mrs. Storer are\\ntheir Mrs. and Miss Palmer--for they are at Bridlington. I am happy to\\nsay, however, that the sum of the account is better than usual. Sir\\nWilliam is returned; from Bridlington they go to Chevet, and she is to\\nhave a young governess under her.\\n\\nI enjoyed Edward\\'s company very much, as I said before, and yet I was\\nnot sorry when Friday came. It had been a busy week, and I wanted a few\\ndays\\' quiet and exemption from the thought and contrivancy which any\\nsort of company gives. I often wonder how you can find time for what you\\ndo, in addition to the care of the house; and how good Mrs. West could\\nhave written such books and collected so many hard words, with all her\\nfamily cares, is still more a matter of astonishment. Composition seems\\nto me impossible with a head full of joints of mutton and doses of\\nrhubarb.\\n\\n_Monday._--Here is a sad morning. I fear you may not have been able to\\nget to the Pump. The two last days were very pleasant. I enjoyed them\\nthe more for your sake. But to-day it is really bad enough to make you\\nall cross. I hope Mary will change her lodgings at the fortnight\\'s end;\\nI am sure, if you looked about well, you would find others in some odd\\ncorner to suit you better. Mrs. Potter charges for the name of the High\\nSt.\\n\\nSuccess to the pianoforte! I trust it will drive you away. We hear now\\nthat there is to be no honey this year. Bad news for us. We must\\nhusband our present stock of mead, and I am sorry to perceive that our\\ntwenty gallons is very nearly out. I cannot comprehend how the fourteen\\ngallons could last so long.\\n\\nWe do not much like Mr. Cooper\\'s new sermons. They are fuller of\\nregeneration and conversion than ever, with the addition of his zeal in\\nthe cause of the Bible Society.\\n\\nMartha\\'s love to Mary and Caroline, and she is extremely glad to find\\nthey like the pelisse. The Debarys are indeed odious! We are to see my\\nbrother to-morrow, but for only one night. I had no idea that he would\\ncare for the races without Edward. Remember me to all.\\n\\n                                  Yours very affectionately,\\n                                                        J.

In April\\nher father in a note to Mrs. Lefroy says: \"I was happy to have a good\\naccount of herself written by her own hand, in a letter from your Aunt\\nJane; but all who love, and that is all who know her, must be anxious on\\nher account.\" We all know how well grounded that anxiety was, and how\\nsoon her relations had to lament over the loss of the dearest and\\nbrightest member of their family.\\n\\nAnd now I come to the saddest letters of all, those which tell us of the\\nend of that bright life, cut short just at the time when the world might\\nhave hoped that unabated intellectual vigor, supplemented by the\\nexperience brought by maturer years, would have produced works if\\npossible even more fascinating than those with which she had already\\nembellished the literature of her country. But it was not to be. The\\nfiat had gone forth,--the ties which bound that sweet spirit to earth\\nwere to be severed, and a blank left, never to be filled in the family\\nwhich her loved and loving presence had blessed, and where she had been\\nso well and fondly appreciated. In the early spring of 1817 the\\nunfavorable symptoms increased, and the failure of her health was too\\nvisible to be neglected. Still no apprehensions of immediate danger were\\nentertained, and it is probable that when she left Chawton for\\nWinchester in May, she did not recognize the fact that she was bidding a\\nlast farewell to \"Home.\" Happy for her if it was so, for there are few\\nthings more melancholy than to look upon any beloved place or person\\nwith the knowledge that it is for \"the last time.\" In all probability\\nthis grief was spared to Jane, for even after her arrival at Winchester\\nshe spoke and wrote as if recovery was hopeful; and I fancy that her\\nrelations were by no means aware that the end was so near.\\n\\n\\n_Note by Lord Brabourne._\\n\\nCassandra\\'s letters tell the tale of the event in words that require no\\naddition from me. They are simple and affecting,--the words of one who\\nhad been stricken by a great grief, but whose religion stood her in\\ngood stead, and enabled her to bear it with fortitude. The firm and\\nloving bond of union which had ever united the Austen family, naturally\\nintensified their sorrow at the loss of one of their number, and that\\nthe one of whom they had been so proud as well as so fond. They laid her\\nwithin the walls of the old cathedral which she had loved so much, and\\nwent sorrowfully back to their homes, with the feeling that nothing\\ncould replace to them the treasure they had lost. And most heavily of\\nall must the blow have fallen upon the only sister, the correspondent,\\nthe companion, the other self of Jane, who had to return alone to the\\ndesolate home, and to the mother to whose comforts the two had hitherto\\nministered together, but who would henceforward have her alone on whom\\nto rely. . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      _Letters from Miss Cassandra Austen to her niece Miss\\n      Knight, after the death of her sister Jane, July 18,\\n      1817._'},\n",

       "  'text': 'WINCHESTER, Sunday.\\n\\nMY DEAREST FANNY,--Doubly dear to me now for her dear sake whom we have\\nlost. She did love you most sincerely, and never shall I forget the\\nproofs of love you gave her during her illness in writing those kind,\\namusing letters at a time when I know your feelings would have dictated\\nso different a style. Take the only reward I can give you in the\\nassurance that your benevolent purpose was answered; you did contribute\\nto her enjoyment.\\n\\nEven your last letter afforded pleasure. I merely cut the seal and gave\\nit to her; she opened it and read it herself, afterwards she gave it to\\nme to read, and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully of its\\ncontents, but there was then a languor about her which prevented her\\ntaking the same interest in anything she had been used to do.\\n\\nSince Tuesday evening, when her complaint returned, there was a visible\\nchange, she slept more and much more comfortably; indeed, during the\\nlast eight-and-forty hours she was more asleep than awake. Her looks\\naltered and she fell away, but I perceived no material diminution of\\nstrength, and though I was then hopeless of a recovery, I had no\\nsuspicion how rapidly my loss was approaching.\\n\\nI have lost a treasure, such a sister, such a friend as never can have\\nbeen surpassed. She was the sun of my life, the gilder of every\\npleasure, the soother of every sorrow; I had not a thought concealed\\nfrom her, and it is as if I had lost a part of myself. I loved her only\\ntoo well,--not better than she deserved, but I am conscious that my\\naffection for her made me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others;\\nand I can acknowledge, more than as a general principle, the justice of\\nthe Hand which has struck this blow.\\n\\nYou know me too well to be at all afraid that I should suffer materially\\nfrom my feelings; I am perfectly conscious of the extent of my\\nirreparable loss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little\\nindisposed,--nothing but what a short time, with rest and change of air,\\nwill remove. I thank God that I was enabled to attend her to the last,\\nand amongst my many causes of self-reproach I have not to add any wilful\\nneglect of her comfort.\\n\\nShe felt herself to be dying about half an hour before she became\\ntranquil and apparently unconscious. During that half-hour was her\\nstruggle, poor soul! She said she could not tell us what she suffered,\\nthough she complained of little fixed pain. When I asked her if there\\nwas anything she wanted, her answer was she wanted nothing but death,\\nand some of her words were: \"God grant me patience, pray for me, oh,\\npray for me!\" Her voice was affected, but as long as she spoke she was\\nintelligible.\\n\\nI hope I do not break your heart, my dearest Fanny, by these\\nparticulars; I mean to afford you gratification whilst I am relieving my\\nown feelings. I could not write so to anybody else; indeed you are the\\nonly person I have written to at all, excepting your grandmamma,--it\\nwas to her, not your Uncle Charles, I wrote on Friday.\\n\\nImmediately after dinner on Thursday I went into the town to do an\\nerrand which your dear aunt was anxious about. I returned about a\\nquarter before six, and found her recovering from faintness and\\noppression; she got so well as to be able to give me a minute account of\\nher seizure, and when the clock struck six she was talking quietly to\\nme.\\n\\nI cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized again with the same\\nfaintness, which was followed by the sufferings she could not describe;\\nbut Mr. Lyford had been sent for, had applied something to give her\\nease, and she was in a state of quiet insensibility by seven o\\'clock at\\nthe latest. From that time till half-past four, when she ceased to\\nbreathe, she scarcely moved a limb, so that we have every reason to\\nthink, with gratitude to the Almighty, that her sufferings were over. A\\nslight motion of the head with every breath remained till almost the\\nlast. I sat close to her with a pillow in my lap to assist in supporting\\nher head, which was almost off the bed, for six hours; fatigue made me\\nthen resign my place to Mrs. J. A. for two hours and a half, when I took\\nit again, and in about an hour more she breathed her last.\\n\\nI was able to close her eyes myself, and it was a great gratification to\\nme to render her those last services. There was nothing convulsed which\\ngave the idea of pain in her look; on the contrary, but for the\\ncontinual motion of the head she gave one the idea of a beautiful\\nstatue, and even now, in her coffin, there is such a sweet, serene air\\nover her countenance as is quite pleasant to contemplate.\\n\\nThis day, my dearest Fanny, you have had the melancholy intelligence,\\nand I know you suffer severely, but I likewise know that you will apply\\nto the fountain-head for consolation, and that our merciful God is never\\ndeaf to such prayers as you will offer.\\n\\nThe last sad ceremony is to take place on Thursday morning; her dear\\nremains are to be deposited in the cathedral. It is a satisfaction to me\\nto think that they are to lie in a building she admired so much; her\\nprecious soul, I presume to hope, reposes in a far superior mansion. May\\nmine one day be reunited to it!\\n\\nYour dear papa, your Uncle Henry, and Frank and Edwd. Austen, instead of\\nhis father, will attend. I hope they will none of them suffer lastingly\\nfrom their pious exertions. The ceremony must be over before ten\\no\\'clock, as the cathedral service begins at that hour, so that we shall\\nbe at home early in the day, for there will be nothing to keep us here\\nafterwards.\\n\\nYour Uncle James came to us yesterday, and is gone home to-day. Uncle\\nH. goes to Chawton to-morrow morning; he has given every necessary\\ndirection here, and I think his company there will do good. He returns\\nto us again on Tuesday evening.\\n\\nI did not think to have written a long letter when I began, but I have\\nfound the employment draw me on, and I hope I shall have been giving you\\nmore pleasure than pain. Remember me kindly to Mrs. J. Bridges (I am so\\nglad she is with you now), and give my best love to Lizzie and all the\\nothers.\\n\\n           I am, my dearest Fanny,\\n                         Most affectionately yours,\\n                                                CASS.

Nothing of the sort could\\nhave been more gratifying to me than the manner in which you write of\\nher; and if the dear angel is conscious of what passes here, and is not\\nabove all earthly feelings, she may perhaps receive pleasure in being so\\nmourned. Had she been the survivor, I can fancy her speaking of you in\\nalmost the same terms. There are certainly many points of strong\\nresemblance in your characters; in your intimate acquaintance with each\\nother, and your mutual strong affection, you were counterparts.\\n\\nThursday was not so dreadful a day to me as you imagined. There was so\\nmuch necessary to be done that there was no time for additional misery.\\nEverything was conducted with the greatest tranquillity, and but that I\\nwas determined I would see the last, and therefore was upon the listen,\\nI should not have known when they left the house. I watched the little\\nmournful procession the length of the street; and when it turned from my\\nsight, and I had lost her forever, even then I was not overpowered, nor\\nso much agitated as I am now in writing of it. Never was human being\\nmore sincerely mourned by those who attended her remains than was this\\ndear creature. May the sorrow with which she is parted with on earth be\\na prognostic of the joy with which she is hailed in heaven!\\n\\nI continue very tolerably well,--much better than any one could have\\nsupposed possible, because I certainly have had considerable fatigue of\\nbody as well as anguish of mind for months back; but I really am well,\\nand I hope I am properly grateful to the Almighty for having been so\\nsupported. Your grandmamma, too, is much better than when I came home.\\n\\nI did not think your dear papa appeared unwell, and I understand that he\\nseemed much more comfortable after his return from Winchester than he\\nhad done before. I need not tell you that he was a great comfort to me;\\nindeed, I can never say enough of the kindness I have received from him\\nand from every other friend.\\n\\nI get out of doors a good deal, and am able to employ myself. Of course\\nthose employments suit me best which leave me most at leisure to think\\nof her I have lost, and I do think of her in every variety of\\ncircumstance,--in our happy hours of confidential intercourse, in the\\ncheerful family party which she so ornamented, in her sick-room, on her\\ndeath-bed, and as (I hope) an inhabitant of heaven. Oh, if I may one day\\nbe reunited to her there! I know the time must come when my mind will be\\nless engrossed by her idea, but I do not like to think of it. If I think\\nof her less as on earth, God grant that I may never cease to reflect on\\nher as inhabiting heaven, and never cease my humble endeavors (when it\\nshall please God) to join her there.\\n\\nIn looking at a few of the precious papers which are now my property I\\nhave found some memorandums, amongst which she desires that one of her\\ngold chains may be given to her god-daughter Louisa, and a lock of her\\nhair be set for you. You can need no assurance, my dearest Fanny, that\\nevery request of your beloved aunt will be sacred with me. Be so good as\\nto say whether you prefer a brooch or ring.
